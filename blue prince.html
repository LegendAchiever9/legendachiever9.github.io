                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Congratulations! You&rsquo;ve inherited your uncle&rsquo;s 45 room manor &mdash; or at least you will, if you&rsquo;re able to find the supposed 46th room. And this is no ordinary manor: it&rsquo;s filled with hidden secrets, tales of political espionage, relics of history, and more for you to explore. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the layout of the manor resets at the end of each day so you best brush up on your room drafting strategy if you want to find all there is to know in this unique blend of roguelite and puzzle games.</span></p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section for Content -->
            <section id="content">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >You&rsquo;re probably wondering why on earth this game has &ldquo;Onion&rdquo; as one of its tags so I&rsquo;ll explain that first. An &ldquo;Onion&rdquo; game by my definition is one that has layers &mdash; a game that has distinct segments that could all functionally serve as a stopping point to the game, only limited by your desire to continue or satisfaction with your progress. These portions also typically correlate to a specific objective that the game puts in front of you, which you can later retrofit to these splits. I&rsquo;ll talk about this for Blue Prince specifically later, but due to the nature of this game it will be past the point of no return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The primary gameplay loop of Blue Prince is simple, you walk up to a door and are offered a choice between three different rooms to draft; once selected they&rsquo;ll slot right into the floorplan and allow you to enter them. The entire manor is a 9x5 grid, so your core purpose will be to explore new rooms and see what lies within them. All of this is in service of reaching the aforementioned Room 46, a secret location which is a requirement to secure your inheritance of the estate. Some rooms will contain a snippet of world history or a painting of your ancestors, while others will contain memos from the staff or electrical wiring for the estate. Since this game has no combat to speak of, the main opposing force to your exploration comes in the form of endurance, or &ldquo;steps&rdquo;. Each time you exit a room, that will cost one step, and managing this resource will be pivotal for progression. The other limiting factor comes in the form of gems and keys &mdash;&nbsp; in-game currency that will make or break your ability to delve into the more remote depths of the estate. So the purest roguelite form of this game comes from managing your economy of these primary resources in order to reach the fabled Room 46.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >In parallel, the rest of the game then takes the form of an escape room style puzzle game where you&rsquo;ll need to find out where Room 46 even is, and how to enter it. This portion of the game manifests from a micro to macro scale: challenges ranging from a simple logic puzzle strictly contained within one room to a widespread scavenger hunt where you&rsquo;ll have to learn the world&rsquo;s history and language. Is this pattern on the floor just interior design, or is it an encrypted solution to a puzzle I haven&rsquo;t found yet? This question will certainly begin to creep into your mind as one of the game&rsquo;s central themes of obsession shows its face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As with most puzzle games, I highly recommend playing this with a friend or two to enhance your experience and mitigate potential frustrations. Especially given the run based nature of this game, having a second set of eyes evaluate your surroundings does wonders for increasing your coverage. In addition, it drastically lowers the chances that you&rsquo;ll have to recreate or revisit a specific construction that may or may not have taken you quite some time to achieve.</span></p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >I have a few minor gripes with the game that all fall under quality of life changes, which I actually think would result in a very nice improvement. Small things like the digging cutscene being skippable or shorter in later runs, keeping safes open once you successfully open them, not needing to adjust the weather vane, saving the computer password and removing the load time after first use, and keeping books in the library after you&rsquo;ve checked them out once are all small paper cuts that really do add up over the significant number of runs in a given playthrough. Making those changes would detract nothing from the game and only serve to respect the players time in a way that allows them to pursue their current goals without making it feel tedious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The elephant in the room when it comes to negatives in a roguelite is of course the random nature of the game. In general, the game does a solid job of giving you quite a few leads and clues to follow, such that you&rsquo;re rarely ever chasing one specific goal. When you do only have one goal, however, the randomness can really show its teeth and be a source of frustration. When you have an idea for how to solve or approach a problem, the last thing you want is for the game to block you from trying it due to factors out of your control. As you progress through the game you&rsquo;ll get more tools to help you skew the odds in your favor by manipulating the draft, but the early-mid game demands a few specific scenarios that are purely up to chance whether you can encounter them in a reasonable time frame or not.&nbsp; My biggest recommendation here is to take aggressive notes about everything you see and to keep a list of situations that you want to try and create, such that you&rsquo;ll always have something that you can try even in a bad run.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >A more general point to this effect is the inherent clash between the two core genres: roguelites encourage moment to moment variety and emergent gameplay while puzzle games ask you to alter your perspective and think about all of the information given to you. As a whole, Blue Prince lands this marriage quite well by creating interesting moments with great payoffs, but isn&rsquo;t without moments where you feel inhibited by the very concept of the game. Overall the game has knockout puzzles that are up there with the best in games, but sometimes finding your way to those puzzles can be more cumbersome than I&rsquo;d prefer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >My final pain point lies with the transition between the third and fourth (final) onion layer of the game. I&rsquo;m quite aware that this is extremely late into the game and that most players will not even want to reach this far, but I&rsquo;ll talk about it in the spoiler section for those who are curious.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >Oh one more thing, this game is definitely less accessible if you happen to be color deficient, so something to keep in mind.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The music is spacey, ethereal, and simply exists besides you in your journey. The soundtrack rarely pushes to get your attention, instead choosing to remain in the background to bolster the atmosphere. Long, droning, otherworldly synths harmonize with one another while a lone bass clarinet fills space on occasion. The bass clarinet is so soulful and cuts straight through the lofty synth lines, with heavy influences from noir and 60s jazz. This OST focuses on the impact of nothingness, only choosing to put moving melodic lines in when it is necessary. This results in a hauntingly beautiful environment accompanied by emotional moments when you finally make a breakthrough in the story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There is a heavy use of fades, both in and out, in this soundtrack to further emphasize the unending circumstance you&rsquo;re in. This infinitum is one that is mostly calm, but one that is never fully resolved as you constantly grasp for some direction in a soundtrack that gives you none, and a game that intentionally gives you the faintest leads to follow. Whether or not you choose to embrace this emptiness and remain at peace on your quest is up to you, and the music sets this tone astonishingly well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Roots Above&rdquo;, &ldquo;Southward Swan&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mortua&rdquo; all beautifully portray this form so if you are ever in need of some music to relax to, pop these on.</span></p>

                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >&ldquo;Westwardly Winds&rdquo; will come on the first time you open the garage and since this is likely your first permanent upgrade, marking this discovery with its own musical moment is quite fitting. The tone of this piece is positive, warm, welcoming, and hopeful; it invites you to rejoice around the notion that there is more to explore than just inside the manor. Even this track plays heavily with the concept of empty space, as the supporting synths rise and recede as the saxophone plays a gorgeous main line, creating troughs to provide the player with time to think and introspect. A rare visit from the piano takes this track out as we get a lovely, repeated resolution to the chord progression of this piece.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Ovinn Nevarei&rdquo; roughly translates to &lsquo;looking to new beginnings&rsquo; and is found throughout the entire game on family crests and documents. But this track plays when the north lever (or its backup) is pulled and continues until you reach Room 46 or the day ends. The repeated notes in the synth remind me of a clock ticking, which is fitting for your dash to the long awaited Room 46. Elongated notes, hairpin fades, and glissandos by now are marquis elements that the composers use to drive emotion in such an atmospheric soundtrack, yet remain extremely effective in making the moment more impactful.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Inneclipse&rdquo; accompanies the cutscene you&rsquo;ll see upon reaching Room 46 for the first time. Again the piano is back for this moment, as we hear a narration of the player character&rsquo;s favorite book by his mother. Longing chords fill the space left by the narrator&rsquo;s breaths as we gain some of the first insight as to the state of the world that has led up to this moment, and a look into what may have become of our mother, Mary. The synths in the background slowly crescendo over the first half until the main melody kicks in and a driving bass brings us to the climax of the piece. Later, repeated eighth notes ground us while a lone synth wails out, as the rest of the instrumentation slowly fades out along with the end of the cutscene. A beautiful and emotional track especially when weighed with the knowledge gained from what you see in the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As you enter the safehouse, &ldquo;Departure&rdquo; opens up as most of the sound track: vacant synth chords and intermittent chimings from the bass clarinet.&nbsp; At 1:08 we kick off a phrase where our old friend the saxophone takes a melancholic lead. This piece is so somber, the remnants of where your mother and the heist crew made their home in the months leading up to the big day. My favorite part of this song is the saxophone handing the melody back to the bass clarinet at 2:22 in a seamless arpeggio that almost hides the instrument switch from you. The piece continues to mellow out to match the emptiness and faded history that finds you in this part of your journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;</span><span >Under the Black Bridge&rdquo; is the song that plays after you unlock the Blackridge vault with three microchips. All of that talk about vacancy and background vibes changes during this piece as you encroach upon one of the largest story beats in the game after your initial exploration of Room 46. We start out with a relatively clean synth establishing an ostinato for this track while we gradually crescendo throughout the whole duration of the track. If drawn out notes could feel like melody, they certainly do in this track as they constantly ebb and flow in and out of the mix while backed up by a powerful bass. All of this gets paired with your ascension of the ancient ruins of Oris until you eventually reach the summit and claim the forgotten Throne Room blackprint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There are quite a few songs that play in game (especially in later layers) but are not included on this release of the OST, though I do want to call out the song that plays in the rough draft version of Room 46. This track once again brings back the piano for such a pivotal moment, and of course features the bass clarinet once more to really bring the game back full circle. Even though the game pokes fun at what a true ending is, the music heard in that sequence definitely cemented that moment as the ultimate resolution for me.</span></p>

                <section id="content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >Alright we can start with how I&rsquo;m defining the onion layers for this game and then go through the strengths of each one in addition to elaborating on the few weak points. Of course we open with the quest for Room 46 but I&rsquo;ll also include the Red Letters in this layer. The discovery and resolution of the painting puzzle are both great moments that set a very clever stage for the safes throughout the manor. Using gate as a homophone for gait is incredible and is probably my favorite moment in this layer. The Great Alzara tells you that there are only seven letters to find instead of the indicated eight, which you may disbelieve as I did, but it does in fact turn out to be true which was quite surprising. The sense of wonder you&rsquo;ll encounter throughout this layer is excellent and serves as a great driver to continue your adventure as I wouldn&rsquo;t call this point a satisfying resolution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The second layer contains the Final Exam and the entirety of the Sanctum including the 8 realms puzzle. Okay this is a really long segment and also has the majority of the randomness induced issues that I referred to earlier. The main two constructions you&rsquo;ll need are having the boiler room connected to the pump room and crafting the power hammer, and given that you have minimal control over drafting at this point it can feel like you&rsquo;re waiting for stars to align here. I will say, the wrench makes so much of this layer more bearable by allowing you to alter rarities of gear rooms (like workshop, pump, and boiler), but I did not find it for 45 days straight, so it's a bit of a toss up on whether or not you&rsquo;ll find it when you need it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The sanctum keys and sigils are quite the endeavor to solve: with the keys being strewn across the entire manor and the information for the sigils being incomplete and reliant on some guesswork. My favorite sanctum key is definitely from the clock tower since that was a fun, self contained puzzle that was satisfying to solve. The sigils themselves are more of a relief when you solve them since you have to combine your actual knowledge of Orindia, the collected shard fragments (of which there are way too many for the Oris sigil), and your deduction of what the realms prominent features are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The Final Exam itself absolutely remains a phenomenal sequence of the game, I haven&rsquo;t seen anything quite like it. The challenge of combining your knowledge of systems across the in-game world such as history, language and math is a novel idea and one that is executed really well, save for a few pieces of information that are harder to come across. You don&rsquo;t need a perfect score to pass the exam but you can only afford a few mistakes so make sure you&rsquo;ve taken notes on everything you need, including the library books that you&rsquo;ll have to re-check out if you&rsquo;ve missed them. </span><strong><br /><br /></strong></p>
<p><span >Once you&rsquo;ve completed all eight sanctum doors and can finally complete the eight realms puzzle, it&rsquo;s quite exciting! The puzzle itself is simple but creative, and piecing together the full journey based on the envelopes was a joy. Once you arrive at the board whose solution has eluded you for so long, you&rsquo;re met with what appears to be a relatively hollow set of letters, but they actually hide the directions to access the third onion layer of the game, starting with the Tomb&rsquo;s second secret order of the angels.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Before I move on though I have to complain about the final portrait in the gallery: the first three were so well designed and felt completely reasonable to solve, especially as a cryptic crossword enthusiast. But the pin cushioned eight leading to the solution of &ldquo;ruminate&rdquo; really did not meet the bar for me. If I was to propose an alternate solution, I feel as though &ldquo;roommate&rdquo; would have been a much better solution for combining &ldquo;room&rdquo; and &ldquo;eight&rdquo; together. This would break the synonym theme which isn&rsquo;t ideal, but I&rsquo;d prefer this puzzle to have been a bit more rigorous. On the bright side, the logic puzzle found within Room 8 was good fun to complete so at least the payoff was worth it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The third layer is a doozy: requiring you to reclaim the throne and clear the eastern tunnel, each of which with their own set of steps to complete. Once you get to this layer of the game, the challenges do require a bit more of a willingness to just try solutions that seem feasible. This echoes one of the main trade offs present in the game: the puzzles and worldbuilding are absolutely fantastic while the procedure to access the puzzles can sometimes dilute the experience. The main blocker to this layer is the castle puzzle, a loose end that had been lingering in my mind for so long given how early it was revealed. The game eventually walks you through it with the original draft of &lsquo;A New Clue&rsquo;; I found that both versions of the book were a joy to go through and felt like their own miniature scavenger hunts. The game doesn&rsquo;t handhold you through the followup to the castle puzzle however, though I found that challenge to be really satisfying to solve. The only comment I&rsquo;ll make is that I wish there was a clock in the crypt so I didn&rsquo;t have to fill out a New York times crossword puzzle on the side while hoping for something to happen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Solving the blue door is pretty easy once you have the sceptre, so all that&rsquo;s left is the finale of the layer: another parlor game. This one is more poignant, however, in its commentary that the game doesn&rsquo;t really have an &ldquo;ending&rdquo; in the traditional sense, rather it's up to you to call it quits whenever you feel satisfied with your experience. Opening the &ldquo;There is no end to this journey&rdquo; greets you with a cutscene telling you to open &ldquo;You have reached the end of your journey&rdquo;, upon doing so you get to read a copy of &lsquo;The Blue Prince&rsquo;. While perhaps confusing at first, this is the last secret left to the player by their mother; aside from some text requiring the magnifying glass which states &ldquo;The true box doesn't always contain the prize&rdquo;. So you&rsquo;re left at another crossroads, do you take this closure about your family&rsquo;s mission as the ending, or do you keep pushing further to examine any potential leads that remain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For players who do press on, they&rsquo;ll reach the fourth (and as far as I know, final) layer of the game which requires even looser connections to be made in order to find your way around. Once you accrue 400 gold to buy the blue tents upgrade, you&rsquo;ll have to start collecting blue memos. This process alone wasn&rsquo;t a big problem, however the fact that every single blue room contains a </span><em><span >different</span></em><span > memo, 40+ of which are completely irrelevant made this a chore. I do wish that the first blue rooms you drafted in room 8 contained the four memos necessary to point you to the coat of arms puzzle. Regardless, once you actually have the necessary information to solve this puzzle it is awesome, though I wish it was a bit clearer that the A1Z26 cipher was the path to go. Finally breaking down the roman numeral on the insignia was a massive accomplishment for a clue that had been looming overhead for effectively the entire game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Now the information revealed by the cipher was extremely cryptic: thinking to use the Room 8 Key in Vault 53 was an absolute leap of faith but my goodness the relief when it worked was palpable. So imagine the brick wall that follows when your only remaining lead in the entire game is &ldquo;still water tints blank books&rdquo;. I genuinely think this is too hard to figure out; there was basically no distinction that the secret back room of the trading post was a distillery. Even if there was, the link between still water and a distillery is quite rough to see. The subsequent clue is another brutal stretch, where you have to place the secret passage in the outer room. At this point of the game, I was basically hoping that whatever seemingly foolish interpretation of a lead entered my head would be correct. For me as a player, this guessing game was nowhere near as fun as solving the actual puzzles once they were presented to you, which brings us to the game's proper finale </span><span >&mdash; the Atelier.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The entire ending sequence is one of the coolest in the game and mapping out the entire rough draft of the manor is such an interesting and creative concept. Recycling the painting puzzle but with more advanced images and combining that with a flurry of Mora Jai boxes repurposes this challenge into a marathon in order to lay out a map and trail to follow in order to reach your prize. This prize is also somewhat contentious: even after everything there is no cutscene, no achievement, nor anything material other than the will of the original owner of the estate, Lady Auravei.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><span >Aside from commending whoever who found these blue pages, the will states that the reader can rest as their journey is at an end: &ldquo;To you, for whom satisfaction is a fleeting companion. To you, who stands now at the end of your journey &mdash; triumphant, exhausted, and justly proud. To you, I grant that which, in life, I have given to no other: My esteem.&rdquo; This is as close to a second credits roll as you&rsquo;ll get, and whether or not that is satisfying to you is totally aligned with the game's portrayal of obsession and ownership. Was surpassing each cryptic roadblock to find where it all started enough, or were you after something </span><em><span >more?</span></em><span > &ldquo;Does it never end&rdquo; and its anagrammed variants throughout the game aptly lay this decision out in front of the player, as does the parlor game from the end of the third layer. Blue Prince is an experience where your payoff is truly decided by your own values, and for me I can happily say that the fourth layer was a rewarding and exciting culmination of a game that had already given so much. Whew, these reviews for onion games are going to be exhausting to write.</span></p>
