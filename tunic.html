                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Tunic is an isometric action game that begins as a charming homage to classic Zelda, but soon reveals a deeper, cryptic world where even the instruction manual is written in an unreadable language. Bursting with secrets and meticulous design, Tunic evolves from a standard adventure into a richly layered puzzle box that is one of the most unique experiences you can find.</span></p>

                <p><span >Tunic is an isometric action game that begins as a charming homage to classic Zelda, but soon reveals a deeper, cryptic world where even the instruction manual is written in an unreadable language. Bursting with secrets and meticulous design, Tunic evolves from a standard adventure into a richly layered puzzle box that is one of the most unique experiences you can find.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CONTENT</strong></p>
<p><span >The core motivation that the game will immediately present to you is one of my favorite mechanics in all of gaming: the Manual. This materialization of an old school instruction booklet serves as your guide to the basics &mdash; here&rsquo;s how to dodge, swing your sword, open your inventory &mdash; but also as a wellspring of mysteries to unpack as you can't read most of it. The manual explains combat through diagrams, tells the game&rsquo;s story in its bespoke language, includes brochure-like entries for each location, and, of course, cleverly hides the vast majority of the game&rsquo;s secrets. Gathering these manual pages is one of the most satisfying and compelling game loops you can imagine, as each find slowly reveals a new part of the world that you seek to understand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As a result, the desire to fill in more of the manual is absolutely key and drives the main game loop. Each new page reveals a new piece of the world&rsquo;s logic that changes how you view your surroundings. That sense of discovery spills into the exploration, which is the backbone of the entire game. You&rsquo;ll traverse ancient ruins, windswept mountaintops, eerie catacombs, and the frog&rsquo;s domain, all while trying to fill in the blanks &mdash; both in the world and in your manual. You're not fully directionless though, as the in-game map is also an astounding centerpiece of the game's design. This map of the world is drawn as you would find it on paper in real life, filled to the brim with scribbles and annotations left behind by a previous intrepid traveler. The map updates in real time, but never holds your hand as you navigate your way around the wondrous world before you.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Aside from manual pages, your sleuthing will be rewarded with a multitude of items, abilities and stat increases to help you get stronger. You may not know what you're picking up each time, but the drive to progress and understand echoes the core theme of the game centered around knowledge.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >What good are stats if you have no place to apply them? The other primary component of the game comes in the form of Combat. The soulslike formula returns with stamina, rolls, parries, and the respawn system so be prepared to battle. Combat gates new areas, and exploration rewards your combat efforts with more tools and insight about the world. It&rsquo;s a classic loop that holds up well enough to support the game&rsquo;s ambitions even though the combat is not as robust as I would like given its prevalence in the game. That being said, it doesn't get in the way too much and diligent explorers should have a fair enough time getting through each hurdle in order to allow the rest of the game&rsquo;s ambition to shine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >As you may guess, there is almost nothing about the story I can discuss before the spoiler section. Just know that you're a cute, small fox dropped into a big world with no clue what&rsquo;s going on. But piece by piece, you&rsquo;ll uncover the tale of those who came before you &mdash; and what&rsquo;s at stake for those who come after.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >As I mentioned earlier, the only critique I'll lead with before the spoiler section is the combat system. Though not terrible, the combat can feel clunky and sluggish. Rolls are slow and the combat as a whole is not tight, you'll sometimes feel yourself floundering about instead of smoothly navigating each situation. Perhaps this is intentional &mdash; you are not an adept warrior, you&rsquo;re a novice fox adventurer who only just found a sword &mdash;&nbsp; yet the result is that combat often feels like a chore more than I&rsquo;d like.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For the imprecise nature of combat, it is also on the quite punishing side with high incoming damage and narrow parry windows. All of this said, the challenge is manageable but not&nbsp; a strong suit especially when compared to sister games like </span><em><span >Death&rsquo;s Door</span></em><span >, where combat feels clean and snappy. This is by no means a deal breaker and the item system enables the combat to be engaging enough to not prevent you from uncovering the amazing mysteries that await you.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Music -->
            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >Before we dive into the soundtrack I want to talk a bit about the sound design in Tunic, since it&rsquo;s actually an interesting problem that isometric perspective games encounter. Even though the character inhabits a 3D world, the relatively fixed camera angle can make it difficult to properly convey the source and intensity of various sounds. Tunic opts for a 2D design for its sound approach that is exclusively calculated in &ldquo;screen space&rdquo;, or only using distances in the plane of the screen relative to the camera. This &mdash; along with some other parameters like the zoom of the camera and the in-world height of the sound source &mdash; creates a full, immersive soundscape that always feels natural. The sound design in Tunic is clean and visceral, bolstered by this clever yet precise mechanism; super interesting! With that out of the way though let&rsquo;s go straight into the tunes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The OST is filled with ambient electronic and synthwave compositions, with occasional interludes into lyrical wind instrument lines. Songs are mostly atmospheric with heavy use of ostinato and reverb to create an ethereal and encompassing sound, yet nothing too strong that would overpower the thoughtful moments. This environmental approach makes climactic moments even more impactful when the music finally comes out of its shell and brings you face to face with tense or cathartic moments that mirror your experience within the game&rsquo;s world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Redwood Colonnade&rdquo; is the theme of the East Forest which serves as the first large area of the game to explore. The track opens up with some light, dreamy synths playing long sustained harmonies with a wind effect in the background. This mystique is followed up by an ostinato in the piano alternating between just two notes. This ambience is joined by a faint conga rhythm which further invokes the feeling of the natural surroundings you find yourself in. At 1:53 a beautifully melancholic pan flute brings us the first melody of the piece, accompanied by a deeper hum in the bass synth. The main line eventually tapers off at 2:05 with a rising glissando that blends into the background mix. This piece is wonderfully effective at providing a sense of scale beyond the comprehension of us as a player at this point yet being mysterious and calming enough to nudge us forwards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another piece that does this brilliantly is &ldquo;Secret of the Forest&rdquo; from the game </span><em><span >Chrono Trigger</span></em><span >. I have to mention this because hearing the East Forest theme in Tunic immediately brought this track to mind. Let&rsquo;s take a quick detour into the structure of these compositions and see why they feel so familiar aside from the clear parallels in the instrumentation. Most notably, that high wind instrument line soaring about a peaceful and relaxing ambience brings some sort of nostalgic and comforting feeling which is perfect for the introductory areas of each game. I&rsquo;ll focus on the alternating piano notes in &ldquo;Redwood Colonnade&rdquo; first: we start out with an oscillation from B-A which is the III chord of F# minor and then move to a G-F# pattern which is the I chord of F# minor. &ldquo;Secret of the Forest&rdquo; on the other hand starts out with the II chord of F minor before going down to the I chord of F minor chord. While not the same, these chord progressions along with their melodies do a phenomenal job of driving their respective songs in similar ways.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Back to business, at 3:13 the song takes a new shape where a rapid cascading piano line and some airy, atmospheric sounds ride atop a deep bass synth before reintroducing the pan flute, but this time taking a slower and more methodical line. This contrast of quick notes like flowing water and the gentle yet firm presence of the high winds give the quiet forest dynamism while still maintaining a sense of warmth and restfulness. A beautifully done track and a great spot for my song of the game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The cutely named &ldquo;Sunset Breakfast&rdquo; is not a long piece, but very quickly establishes its vibe. A lone piano is our lead voice here with a drum pattern that takes inspiration from lofi. This chill, retro aesthetic exudes comfort which is absolute perfection for the theme song of the lovely old home that we can find within the overworld &mdash; sweet and lovely.</span></p>
<p><br /><span >&ldquo;Ocean Glaze&rdquo; brings us to the beaches of the Ruined Atoll and the echoing percussion immediately sets the tone. Slightly funky synths help establish groove as we slowly introduce more synths into the mix. This track takes its time just as a beach theme should, up until 1:16 where a higher tempo drum beat and fast moving runs grab our attention. Then some retrowave style synths reminiscent of 16-bit games flutter into the front seat with alternating notes that jump between each headphone ear. This track manages to remain interesting by never sitting still, yet firmly holding a relaxed, carefree vibe through instrumentation, pulsing percussion beats, and repeated keyboard patterns.</span> </p>

                <!-- Section for Spoiler Music -->
                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >Now we have the three overworld themes that you&rsquo;ll hear over the course of your journey: &ldquo;Memories of Memories&rdquo; , &ldquo;Forget to Forget&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Remember to Remember&rdquo;. They all share a main musical idea but each take their own approach to the instrumentation and composition. </span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >The first starts out with a plucky, reverbing synth which nicely matches the early soundfont of Tunic. The main melody is on piano with clap percussion moving the piece forward. The original synth rarely backs out as it continues to ripple throughout the tune while the strings play sustained harmonies to fill out the track. </span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >The second takes a more subdued approach with a marimba-like synth leading the way; marimba is a fairly common instrument used underwater, so using it throughout the parts of the game surrounding the Ruined Atoll are a nice touch. The main melody is on a light synth that even mimics the dropping of water with echoing synths to support and repeated patterns in fainter synths and the bassline to further reinforce the fluid nature of this recapitulation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The final rendition of the overworld motif takes a starkly different variation on the theme with a traditional piano opening up the piece alone. A string bass comes in along with faint bongo patterns as supporting synths slowly and very quietly fade in. The main line is on a very clean synth with barely any effects applied just like the instrumental setup of the rest of the track. The piano really is the star of the show here as even the repeated ostinato figure is in piano and only some light string harmonies play in the background for this piece. A much emptier arrangement of this theme paradoxically speaks volumes by creating a highly reflective moment whenever you&rsquo;re indoors while in the overworld.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Knight&rdquo; is your first boss fight so why not have it be a synth-house theme dotted with piano embellishments and haunting vocals. The artificial nature of the Guardian of the West Garden contrasts with the all natural environment and you hear this clash in the music. A techno style beat and percussion pattern follow the electronic style we expect, but then the piano and distinctly animalistic wails that surround this digital core bring a new light to this theme. Plenty of momentum in the percussion and bass synths to drive you forward but with enough beauty to fit the elegance of the gardens, sometimes opposites do attract.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another boss theme makes the list with the &ldquo;The Librarian&rdquo; theme. We start out with a piano that soon distorts into a twisted reverberating bassline. This abrupt take over sets a precedent for the rest of the piece: the natural and sentient orchestral instrumentation struggles against an inhuman and mechanical force. An edgy, plucked harp synth comes in before a short piano interlude which then takes us into a harpsichord lead with low string harmonies. Brass horns accompanied by a choir soon find themselves overwhelmed by dissonant synths on top of a sharp bassline and empty, echoing vocals. This piece is a battle of acoustic and electronic instrumentation while you engage with the Librarian who &mdash; unbeknownst to you at the time &mdash; guards one third of a key to forbidden knowledge that transformed the fox civilization into soulless husks. This fight is literally a representation of what happens when you lose your way and sacrifice your humanity (foxanity?) and the music drives that point home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Round Table&rdquo; is the theme for the Cathedral gauntlet that will test your wits in combat more than your strength. At 0:39 the percussion kicks into high gear to provide full momentum for our test of battle. Glistening synth runs join the piano for the main melody on top of a deep, distorted bass line. In between some of the phrases you can even hear a quick violin lick to keep up the intensity. Brass-like synths soon join in harmony as we crescendo and add fast synth lines that vibrate through the tune up into the next section. 1:27 puts the reverberating synths to the background with the percussion as the piano doubles itself to take a slower yet firmer main line as stakes rise. Excellent tension building and lots of rhythmic layering creates an air of desperation at the end of the world before the instrumentation slowly drops away and only wisps of wind, a distorted piano, and harsh synths remain and dwindle to nothing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Sageless&rdquo; is the beautiful track underscoring the hidden Fairy Cave. Plinking notes with plenty of reverb mimic the aquatic, mellow cave that the fairies inhabit. We have repeated ascending lines that echo after one another, a staple for calming, water adjacent pieces. We have sustained string chords underneath along with a slow moving yet lovely string melody. The lack of movement in the melody is compensated by the plucking synths and harmony in the supporting lines to create an elegant, otherworldly moment of peace and quiet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Heir&rdquo; starts out like many great final bosses &mdash; with an ominous piano intro. The piano dominates the track while fluttering synths and low string harmonies each take their turn. At&nbsp; 1:30, the pan flute makes it return to take the lead melody as we begin our crescendo and slowly increase the intensity. The percussion joins while more retro synths bounce around our ears into the drop at 2:12. The somber piano grounds the piece while the electronic synths evoke chaos and ever repeating movement. All the while we have the percussion to drive us forward and the wind lines to float atop the rest; powerful with feeling overpowering.</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >The great struggle you&rsquo;ll endure against the Heir is met with the &ldquo;Ascendance&ldquo; track during your subsequent imprisonment in the Shadow Oubliette. A tragic piano starts out before being slowly consumed by eerie ambient synths. This then devolves into distorted mechanical synth that brings an extraordinarily heavy bass note as we unfortunately renew the cycle that causes life to suffer. A brutally inhuman ending that comes as much from the music as it does from the cutscenes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >This bad ending leads us to the sad version of the ending credits in &ldquo;Ruin Seeker&rdquo;. This melancholic, jazzy track in D minor is a lower tempo and pitched down variation of the main motif that we&rsquo;ll discuss in a bit. Somber piano, vacant synth claps, and a lonely flute provide a fitting backdrop for a memory sequence in which we are alone, unable to share the knowledge that can change the future of the fox clan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >However if you could do something different, how would the music change? That&rsquo;s exactly what we get clued into in the song &ldquo;This Time It's Different&rdquo;, now in B flat minor. This reprise of &ldquo;Ruin Seeker&rdquo; plays as you finally move past the mountain door and claim the final page of the manual. An excellent music reference to the fact that this is what has the power to change your fate and lead you to a new resolution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >So we approach the Heir once again as the theme &ldquo;Transcendence&rdquo; plays with the exact same intro piano. However, we indeed hear something different as a quickly moving synth bubbles up to the forefront. The flute returns in a hopeful way, indicating that perhaps we&rsquo;ve found exactly what we were looking for as we share the full story of the fox clan and break the destructive cycle for good.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >When all is said and done we finally reach the credits piece &ldquo;From Far Shores&rdquo; which is effectively a reprise of &ldquo;To Far Shores&rdquo;, the main menu theme. There are some minor differences between these two pieces like the fast moving ostinato is played by the piano instead of a synth at 1:43 in the former and 1:57 in the latter track. Otherwise, the songs are quite similar with some timing differences for different instrument entrances, fully doubling down on resolution of the cycle. Filled with energetic synths and hopeful melodic lines, a fitting end to a beautifully emotional end credits as we are finally united with the Heir and able to enjoy the small things in life, together.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For a game where the soundtrack generally takes a backseat while you&rsquo;re focused on the gameplay, there is a lot to unpack in this OST. There are many subtle choices in the composition of each track that impact the experience of Tunic in wonderful ways, even if you don&rsquo;t pick up on them the first time.</span></p>
                </section>

                <!-- Section for Spoiler Content -->
                <section id="content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >Continuing our discussion on pain points, there is one more to call out on the combat side which is the heir. This final boss fight, while not required for the good ending, is quite a slog to get through. A large health bar in combination with the imprecise combat system is not an ideal match and ends up being more grueling than gratifying.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Beyond that, most of my remaining critiques are aimed at some of the later-game puzzles in layers two and three. Before we dive into that though, let&rsquo;s break down the concept of the onion layers. We've touched on the onion concept before, but they&rsquo;re core to the design of Tunic, split into four primary sections: the Zelda-like, completing the manual, finding the secret treasures, and finally the ARG (alternate reality game).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >We've discussed the first layer at length &mdash; where the world&rsquo;s mysteries and the combat systems propel you forward. The shortcuts scattered throughout the map are a wonderful reward for thorough exploration, making for some truly magical moments. Combined with the warp pads, they make backtracking through the interconnected world a much less laborious task. The manual pages continue to be a marvel as you collect more of them, with the most notable being the introduction of the holy cross. This story point has been in plain sight for the entire game (in a readable language, no less). The reveal that it&rsquo;s been accessible to you all along as simple directional inputs is phenomenal. This kicks off the second layer with a bang and truly shifts your worldview. It&rsquo;s an unforgettable moment on par with the earlier discovery of warp pads and prayer obelisks, but with an even greater sense of amazement.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The second layer is mostly driven by your pursuit of Ending B. The final page you will likely acquire is of course page one behind the monumental mountain door, containing what I claim to be one of the best puzzles in video games. The golden path puzzle is a stroke of genius, with several stand out moments from a coffee stain on the manual to navigating through a mysterious second save file. Tracing out this enormous, game spanning puzzle in MS paint was a phenomenal and unforgettable experience. The idea to clearly yet innocently place over fifty line segments in the manual which you&rsquo;ll eventually need to combine is an amazing idea. What&rsquo;s even more stunning is that you probably never saw it coming, only when the pieces clicked into place did you happen upon the eureka moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The third layer is also amazing, the hunt for the remaining fairies and secret treasures is enjoyable and presents some great puzzles. Not all are winners though, as some puzzles end up being more difficult to execute than to decipher. Challenges of this nature that are extremely obscure or completely missing a clue are rare but certainly on the frustrating side when you encounter them, such as the rotating water reflection, flower wall bomb, and nighttime yoga puzzles. A bit more of a push in the right direction through manual scribbles or the environment would go a long way in making these more satisfying.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The other problem here lies in the language department: the secret treasure found on page one requires fully decoding the tunic language. That is a staggeringly high investment to make that is far from ideal. I would have certainly preferred for that difficulty increase to take place in layer four where the majority of language translation takes place. Capping off layer three with the softest feather riddle in English would have been a great end for most players (myself included), save for the complex wordplay check for the meaning of &ldquo;down&rdquo;. The riddle requires a reasonably strong grasp of the English language which I certainly don't think is optimal in a game as elegant as Tunic usually is.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The fourth and final layer is, of course, the ARG that requires not only a full translation of the language, but also an investigation into the sound files of a website. This is a fun community-driven puzzle that&rsquo;s better tackled through forums and Discord servers than alone. While it's not my personal favorite, I appreciate the ambition and the unique challenge it brings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Peeling back each layer of the game ties back to the story; What starts off as cute gradually grows sad and soon completely tragic. Fortunately, the good ending earned by fully restoring the manual and breaking the cycle offers a redemption that ties perfectly into Tunic&rsquo;s central theme: understanding. The fox people suffer because they don&rsquo;t know their history or their place in the world. Similarly your journey begins shrouded in a veil of darkness, unaware of what role you play in everything. It&rsquo;s only by uncovering knowledge &mdash; and ultimately sharing it &mdash; that allows the world to heal.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The shortcuts scattered throughout the world, the warp pads, and the brilliance of the manual all reinforce this theme. It&rsquo;s not just about solving puzzles, it&rsquo;s about sharing discovery. Whether you're drawing the golden path in MS Paint like me or parsing riddles with friends, Tunic is at its best when it invites connection &mdash; and it sticks the landing with such elegance that you can&rsquo;t help but marvel at it.</span></p>
