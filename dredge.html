                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >It's a narratively driven, open world fishing game with a day/night cycle! Explore an archipelago and meet odd characters throughout the world as you venture to complete your fishing encyclopedia. Everything is nice and normal, but something feels just a bit off? It&rsquo;s probably just you getting tired, don&rsquo;t worry. </span></p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section for Content -->
            <section id="content">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >The art style of this game is absolutely gorgeous and is a shining example as to why games don&rsquo;t have to look realistic to be a joy to play. When you&rsquo;re not moving or fishing, time stands still and transforms your game world into what looks like a landscape painting. Driving your little dingy around this world feels cozy and is the ideal backdrop for some fishing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The gameplay itself puts slightly more depth on the typical fishing minigame: there are five (six with DLC) minigames for you to play depending on what you&rsquo;re catching, and they&rsquo;re pretty satisfying! Nothing hard and you actually can&rsquo;t lose a fish like in Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing, it will only pass more in-game time if you make an error. Once you catch it, now it's time to place it in your boat! You have a tetris-like inventory minigame where you have to physically place each fish in your boat and they have unique shapes. Not only that, but your engines, lights, fishing rods, and other customizations also take up physical inventory space with different shapes that you&rsquo;ll have to all make fit nice and snug. It ends up being a reasonably fun way to limit the inventory and finding the perfect orientation to fit that last fish is an absolutely satisfying feeling. Only beaten by cargo space upgrades that will lift such a burden off your chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There is another significant gameplay element that gets displayed under the in-game clock, the panic meter. I&rsquo;d be remiss to not mention it as that would be false advertising, but I shall go no further in explaining it. Just get a good night&rsquo;s rest and you won&rsquo;t have any problems. Go past the point of no return if you want to know more. My coyness aside &mdash; note that this game does feature elements of atmospheric horror &mdash; this isn&rsquo;t just a happy peaceful time, so consider yourself warned.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Nothing too much here outside of expected issues you may take up with a fishing game. Things take time, and especially if you find the core gameplay loop to be a chore, it only continues for the rest of the game. But if the charm of going out for a fish, selling your haul, resting for the night, and going back out for more allures you, then the game provides this feeling in spades at a high quality.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >On a similar note, the gameplay is not deep (insert ocean joke here). If that&rsquo;s what you prefer it is certainly not what Dredge is trying to offer. This game is about ambience, story, and the simple yet enthralling craft of fishing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The rather quick passage of time would be really frustrating if it actually impacted the course of the game, but fortunately it does not! Really don&rsquo;t feel pressured by the surface level day counter, just play at your pace and there shouldn&rsquo;t be any big problems with this mechanic.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The soundtrack is immaculate and could not be more fitting for this game. Mostly atmospheric with beautiful instrumentation and some of the most soul-touching cello you can get. Almost the entire soundtrack is in a minor key which ties well with the solitary nature of the experience. Strings and winds dominate this soundtrack but take a perfect backseat to accompany your adventure. Comforting melodies when you approach the familiar sight of home, bouncing shanties as you approach a trading pontoon, and melancholic chords as you glide over the open ocean away from land. The opening of the game is a masterpiece in tone setting and the music is a large part of that. There is a shift in the vibe of the game as you progress and the music matches it masterfully, even cueing you into what may lie beneath the surface of the game (and water). Maybe not everything in the music is comfy and cozy, what feeling does it evoke from you? Just sit on the main menu music for a bit, perhaps:)</span></p>

                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >Okay so this game is actually an eldritch horror tale cloaked in the veil of a peaceful fishing game. The music does an exceptional job at desperately trying to warn you that not everything is peachy keen in the world around you. Let&rsquo;s take a dive into the music starting with the pieces that envelop the theme of the Marrows and that of the Eldritch. First we have &ldquo;The Restless Town&rdquo; which plays while you&rsquo;re docked in Greater Marrow. This theme in F# minor gives off feelings of melancholy with a pinch of hope and is backed by the slow and wistful flute melody, sustained chords in the high strings, all while the harp and piano trudge on in the bassline. &ldquo;The Path to the Door&rdquo; is the theme of Blackstone Isle which is the most pivotal location in the story of Dredge. This time we&rsquo;re in E minor which evokes feelings of sadness, introspection, melancholy, and longing. This is totally on brand once you know the story and the significance of this place with relation to the fisherman (a.k.a the collector) and his wife. You can just </span><em><span >feel</span></em><span > the unsettling nature of the game kick in here and the peace of the Marrows surely is less comfortable as you hear this theme more often. The leitmotif for the eldritch or otherworldly happenings of the game is contained in this piece as descending notes on the harp. </span><span >&ldquo;The Corrupted Canopy&rdquo; features a demonic sounding cello which only bolsters the ominous feeling of the A minor key. But as you listen, keep an ear out for a somewhat distorted version of the harp line motif from earlier signifying how much deeper into the abyss you&rsquo;ve gone throughout your journey&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Periphery&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Doldrums&rdquo;, and &ldquo;The Return&rdquo;&nbsp; are some of my favorite themes in the game. When they kick in as you sail about the Marrows you just get a rush of nostalgia and a yearning feeling flowing over you. The F# minor key of course matches the theme of Great Marrow and gives you just a bit of hope and beauty amongst the gloom around you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The Traveler Themes are absolute bangers: the heart of a sea shanty but the song isn&rsquo;t sure how to be happy. Hearing these themes after rushing to the pontoon after the horrors of the night is a surreal feeling. Despite their somewhat dark undertones, nothing will comfort you more than a chat with the Traveling Merchant accompanied by a lively accordion urging you to push on in your quest. &ldquo;The Resilient Traveler&rdquo; is in A minor which pulls back a bit on the sadness of the Marrows into something a bit more neutral as you venture out past your comfort into the Gale Cliffs. The &ldquo;Exotic Traveler&rdquo; in E</span><span >â™­</span><span > Major marks a strong change as we&rsquo;re finally in a major key, as this pontoon shimmering in the Stellar Basin gives you a feeling of resolute solidarity. While things are changing and unpleasant happenings have increased their presence, you can and will trudge to continue your journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Sect of the Deep&rdquo; perfectly recreates the feeling of impending darkness looming over your head yet it comes from within. The deep tones of the cello go straight through you and eventually are accompanied by bassoon lines and dissonant piano chords. For the first area where unnatural beings are present even without panic this is incredibly effective. It&rsquo;s not fully oppressive though as a lone flute and some high strings struggle to surface amidst the darkness yet represent a beacon of hope to guide your way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The next few tracks depend on the ending you get so let&rsquo;s take some time to talk about the real story of the game and the twists along the way. If you explore diligently you&rsquo;ll come across several empty camps that have clearly seen recent use, and eventually arrive at the current &ldquo;home&rdquo; of the Old Mayor. This is a required interaction that gives you a chance to finally act on what the Lighthouse Keeper has been alluding to throughout the game and eventually confront The Collector. And maybe it was the bottled messages about the poor couple in 1927, maybe it was the Lighthouse Keeper, maybe it was the portrait of The Collector in all of your interactions with him, or maybe it was just suspicion, but when you finally take the book from him it is revealed that The Collector has been nothing but your reflection the whole time. A side of yourself clinging to the past, desperate to bring back the wife that you lost, tempting fate by going against the natural (or unnatural) order of the deep.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Depending on whether you follow &ldquo;his&rdquo; orders or take matters into your own hands, you will either get the bad or good ending respectively. This changes the final themes of the game where in the bad case you will hear &ldquo;Her Theme (Drowned)&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Door (Drowned)&rdquo;, while in the good version you will hear &ldquo;Her Theme (Lucid)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Main Theme (Lucid)&rdquo;. Let&rsquo;s take a listen to what happens here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Her Theme (Drowned)&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Door (Drowned)&rdquo; musically debut the music box as a haunting lullaby-esque melody plays in the key of E minor. Also notice that this music box plays the same motif of the eldritch or the unknown as we first heard early in the game, it&rsquo;s all coming together (in a bad way, but still)! As we hit a ritardando and fade out, a female vocal leads us into the next track. Then the low strings bellow in along with a male choir as you realize your mistake. War drums and the burning facade of the Marrows firmly cement a death march not only for you, but for the world. And just as suddenly as it arrived, it all fades out to be replaced by the music box and lone female vocal, and eventually just a piano as the vestiges of humanity ebb away.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Her Theme (Lucid)&rdquo; and &ldquo;Main Theme (Lucid)&rdquo; play and okay now things are better! A delicate piano plays this theme in A minor matching the original theme of the Marrows. High strings join in as we finally shift to something that resembles hope! We have a flute and oboe as the voicing of the wife finally reaching closure in the afterlife. This is promptly joined by the bassoon as the fisherman, ready to accept the happenings of the world and join his wife to be at peace. And the world doesn&rsquo;t perish in a fiery grave, that&rsquo;s good too.It&rsquo;s worth noting that this reprise takes &ldquo;Main Theme&rdquo; from the title screen at the very beginning of this experience and replaces the longing cello which symbolizes a deep, human uncertainty with the manifestation of the fisherman and his wife. While you have the same melody,a change in instrumentation and the high strings providing some colorful chords really help shift this ending to a much more positive tone.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The Iron Rig Music and the entire Iron Rig DLC is just an absolute bop. Tell me you&rsquo;re not vibing to this intro, you can&rsquo;t! &ldquo;The Iron Rig Theme&rdquo; starts out with some deep chanting and mechanical groaning which perfectly sets the stage for you to sail up to this massive, man-made monster of steel in the middle of the sea. This breaks out into the main theme of the DLC played by an accordion. Then the organ takes over turning this quick moving sea shanty into a funeral dirge as man and machine clash with cosmic forces beyond our understanding. The low strings, choir, and solo violin add so much texture to this piece and it's just outstanding. &ldquo;The Return&rdquo; aligns itself much more with the sound of the rest of the game. Hauntingly beautiful and filled with sorrow. The composition is jaw-dropping as the baseline piano moving chords and occasional flourishes in the right hand decorate this tune. &ldquo;The Reopening&rdquo; not only reopens the rig for its drilling operation, but reopens the leitmotif of the eldritch horrors in the deep. Faint flutes and a backing piano are all that accompany a gorgeous cello solo that penetrates the soul.</span></p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >Okay now that I&rsquo;ve yapped about music for longer than 3 days of fishing, let&rsquo;s talk about the main gameplay system I couldn&rsquo;t discuss without spoilers: the panic system. The panic system manifests as an eye that slowly moves from completely closed, to bloodshot and scrambling to find any point of focus. This meter builds when you&rsquo;re out at night in the darkness. If your rig is well lit you can stave off panic for a time, but you can fully reset it by resting at any port. Panic also escalates extremely quickly whenever you encounter any horrors of the deep. This system works incredibly well as certain enemies you will never even see if your panic is low enough, quite similar to the Insight mechanic from Bloodborne. The main drawback is that if you simply rest each night and don&rsquo;t venture out, you&rsquo;ll rarely have high enough panic to interact with this part of the game. The main way the game draws you out from this is by sporting a significant amount of fish species that only spawn at night, as well as the wisps fog that you see in your travels. Catching every kind of fish was the only motivator that I needed and that should have you roaming out at night at least occasionally. The fog is also another clever way to induce panic, if your lights are on the miasma will chase you and induce panic, but if your lights are off to avoid it, the darkness will creep up your panic. Overall I really like this system and it adds the right amount of peril to the game without overwhelming the player (as long as you remember to sleep).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The other main system is fish aberration, which are essentially variants of each fish species that have mutated in strange or grotesque ways. Catching each of these contributes to the total collection but since there are ways to increase your chance of catching an aberration this isn&rsquo;t too painful. An underrated aspect of these fish lie in none other than their flavor text (descriptions). The prose in these 1-2 sentences is honestly incredible, each of them could be the start of a novel. They also do wonders at inspiring the mind to wander, here&rsquo;s one: </span><em><span >"Staring outwards, unblinking. Eyes borrowed from a larger being but not the mind to process what it sees."</span></em><span >. While catching one of every fish is immensely satisfying for those who enjoy collecting, the real reward is in these descriptions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The gradual descent into madness throughout the game is paced quite well. If the music didn&rsquo;t cue you into something being fishy, perhaps the first aberration you catch will. Or maybe you&rsquo;ll notice that the monster of the Gale Cliffs has only one cyclopean eye (the first encounter with this creature is incredible by the way. Such a memorable moment that can really catch you off guard). If you venture towards the sinkhole at the center of Stellar Basin and look beneath the surface something may catch your eye. But if all of that fails, the Twisted Strand is where the game fully leans into its lovecraftian nature with the introduction of &ldquo;mind suckers&rdquo; &mdash; eldritch creatures that drive people to an insanity only cured by death. If you&rsquo;ve been heeding the advice to not stay out at night for too long, this will be one hazard that is not so easily avoidable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The DLCs (The Pale Reach + The Iron Rig) can best be described as &ldquo;more&rdquo; of the base game. If this game is your cup of tea then you&rsquo;ll certainly enjoy the DLCs, though I would recommend playing the game with the DLCs available as they are much more impactful if you naturally encounter them throughout your adventure. The Pale Reach has you explore an icy domain and uncover the mystery of what happened to the crew that has their spirits encased in ice. Very helpful rewards await you here and the main danger in the narwhal is quite fun to observe and play around.The Iron Rig adds significantly more content which takes quite a long time to get through. This adds new objectives at each of the 5 major locations in the game, hence my recommendation to play this in tandem with a full playthrough. Enhance your equipment with new technologies and discover what happens when corporate greed meets its match with scientific research of the eldritch unknown.</span></p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p><span >If you are fan of fishing in games look no further than Dredge. The open world sailing of Wind Waker has never looked better and what better activity to do than fish? Combine that with a story concept so disparate that you absolutely will not expect it until it's fully upon you. An immersive world and brilliant soundtrack keep your simple mission to reel in all kinds of fish engaging and wondrous with each new discovery. And if the thought of a world where everything is just a little bit off entices you, this is a must play for sure.</span></p>
