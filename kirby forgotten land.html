                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p>Kirby goes 3D! What happens when you take an adorable ball of joy and happiness and plop him in an abandoned urban world overrun by beasts? The latest interpretation of Kirby gets so much right: taking the tried and true from the old games while making improvements to progression and flaunting an out-of-the-park soundtrack.</p>
            </section>

                <p><span >Kirby has always been a bit of a strange platformer given that you can float indefinitely and gain height. As a result, levels typically get filled with secrets and missable areas to add some stakes to your advancement through each level. In the jump to 3D, Kirby&rsquo;s float has been modified to only allow you to gain a certain amount of height relative to the platform beneath him. This is actually a pretty clean solution to the problem and allows for the platforming to feel solid enough given the lack of complexity. Pair that with the same swathe of mini puzzles, timed challenges, and missable objectives, and you have truly engaging levels. Getting everything done in your first runthrough of a level is quite the challenge and going for 100% completion will definitely have you keeping an eye out for every detail in each level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I won&rsquo;t go into too much detail about the story of a Kirby game, but Kirby needs to save the world again. Although this time accompanied by a cute elephant mouse being called Elfilin after getting whisked away to a new world. Find familiar friends and foes alongside new enemies that make up the Beast Pack in an endeavour to get back to Planet Popstar&hellip; and defend the galaxy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Copy abilities are of course the main vehicle for combat in the game, but with a new twist: each ability has multiple upgrades that you can find throughout the game that turn basic fire breathing into something much more spectacular. This kept me looking around every corner for the next new transformation I could find; a welcome addition for items to look for in each level. The game also introduces some new copy abilities which I found very entertaining, you&rsquo;ll know them when you see them. All of this combines with the newly minted &ldquo;Mouthful Mode&rdquo;, where Kirby attempts to inhale real world objects that are just a bit too big, so he merely wraps himself around their shape. Now if you think this is a tad unsettling you&rsquo;d be correct, but it is a humorous way to increase the variety throughout the game. Some definitely were more fun than others, but overall a neat enough mechanic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >One major twist they&rsquo;ve brought in is the addition of a perfect dodge which allows Kirby to go into a flurry rush a la Breath of the Wild. Cartwheel dodging all over 3D arenas and then going to town in bullet time after a well executed dodge is a new feeling for Kirby games, and I&rsquo;m here for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >If you ever thought that Kirby needed some city management in it, well you&rsquo;re in for a treat since now you can work to nurture and grow Waddle Dee Town! Instead of selecting your gamemode or minigames from the menu like in prior games, now everything is encompassed within your town. Each level contains hidden Waddle Dees&rsquo; to save, which is done by completing hidden quests that you have to uncover throughout each level. To express their gratitude for your efforts, they&rsquo;ll help build your town to be the best it can be! This became a much more seamless way to incorporate minigames into the main journey of the game so a big plus from me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I&rsquo;ve mentioned collecting a few times already so let's get more into it. To reach 100% completion of the game, you must collect every figurine from the gacha capsules in Waddle Dee Town, this is not a joke. Some figurines can also only be acquired from reaching certain milestones throughout the game and post-game. This turns each level into a collectathon: complete the level, find a copy ability blueprint, farm enough money to play at the gacha machines, and discover all of the hidden quests in each level to save every Waddle Dee. So although the main game is not very challenging and the platforming is simple, you&rsquo;ll be planning your moves to collect as much as you can in one run. Every time you complete a level it will reveal a quest you haven&rsquo;t discovered, and a helpful Waddle Dee in town will let you know if you&rsquo;ve missed a blueprint, so there isn&rsquo;t too much trouble going back to collect what you&rsquo;ve missed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Minigames are a big part of Kirby games and they&rsquo;re pretty fun this time around! You&rsquo;ve got the overcooked minigame, motion control ball maze, boss rush colosseum, and of course, fishing. I would have loved some more multiplayer/competitive minigames like Samurai Kirby to engage friends more, but not a big deal at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >They&rsquo;ve also added a system called Treasure Roads which are time trials where you can test your mettle with every copy ability and all of its upgrades! These are quite fun challenges that provide a nice respite from the normal level progression of the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The post-game adds one final collection layer and the classic Kirby endgame that I&rsquo;ll discuss further after the point of no return.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Honestly there isn&rsquo;t much to say here other than the hidden quests for boss fights. There are 5 hidden quests per level, boss levels included. Normally a level will have somewhat intuitive events where you&rsquo;ll naturally uncover and complete each quest, however for bosses that just doesn&rsquo;t remain true. There are some quests that are constant, but otherwise you&rsquo;ll be running a boss fight multiple times just to uncover which specific copy ability you needed to use in order to save that last Waddle Dee. Slight nuisance but overall not too bad, also fully mitigated if you&rsquo;re willing to look up the quests in advance. This same effect does happen for each level on occasion, where running through the same level for the 4th time because you accidentally killed the enemy you needed to unlock a door can be annoying. Minor gripes but if you&rsquo;re playing the game nice and relaxed or with a friend, it shouldn&rsquo;t pose much of a problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Not really a pain point since it doesn&rsquo;t affect your completion, but some of the treasure road time challenges are actually brutal! Going pretty quickly with next to no mistakes would occasionally have me beating the advanced time by 1 second, very little room for error here. Fortunately the time challenge only nets you some extra money which you can easily get through other means if you&rsquo;re not set on completing them all like I was (I don&rsquo;t recommend it).</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>Kirby music is just so lively it makes you smile and this game is no exception. The game actually takes a pretty new angle towards the soundtrack in that the old themes are not used that much, in contrast to other titles where leitmotifs and remixes are incredibly prominent. There are moments here where longtime fans will have no choice but to bop their head along to Green Greens or certain character themes that weâ€™ll discuss after the point of no return, but overall you can look forward to a high quality spread of new tracks and ideas.

                <!-- Section for Spoiler Music -->
                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >The ending sequence to the true ending capitalizes on the introduction of the new invincibility candy by taking a variation of it in &ldquo;A Full-Speed Farewell from the New World&rdquo;. This familiar yet remixed theme that has been slowly fed to you throughout the game makes an already memorable moment feel extremely satisfying and is a great way to cap off the adventure.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >King Dedede in his beast mask form is back and of course that means a new remix to his theme and it&rsquo;s back in a big way. &ldquo;Roar of Dedede" and &ldquo;The King's Turn to Shine&rdquo; take the beloved Penguin King&rsquo;s theme and give it a breath of fresh air, combining bestial chants and traditional drums to complement his rule of the Beast Pack. I&rsquo;m not sure why I wasn&rsquo;t anticipating for Dedede to appear in this game, but I was so hyped when he got revealed. Both of his fights are fun, cinematic, and very Kirby (aside from his first fight move where he literally uses the Elden Ring ground slam).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The track for Alivel Mall is one of the best musical creations to come out of the game: it&rsquo;s groovy yet lighthearted and really allows the game to start off with a bang following the &ldquo;New World&rdquo; opening which sports real lyric vocals for what I believe is the first time! Alivel Mall as a stage also evolves with the game: from the overgrown state you find it in, to its dilapidated state in the desert ruins, and finally to its warped state where you&rsquo;ll find the Alivel leitmotif present in &ldquo;Faded Dream of a Psychomeddler&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Northeast Frost Street&rdquo; also comes in as a piece that instantly placed itself as a classic for me. Kirby has always excelled at calm, ambient music even though it is rarely used amongst the hectic gameplay typically found in the series. I think the 3D environments really allowed the writers to place beautiful but low tempo melodies amidst levels that are engaging. Ice skating around a frozen park to this track while drilling up hidden Waddle Dee chests and looking around the corner for a sneakily placed alley works wonders.</span></p>

                <section id="content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >The post-game in a reasonably clever way mixes each of the worlds into an amalgam of its levels. Running through these mutated levels while trying to solve mini puzzles to piece together Leongar&rsquo;s soul is quite engaging and served as a neat memory lane as I approached the endgame. These final levels are split into 5 sections each and Elfilin will tell you when you&rsquo;ve found every piece for your section, but if you do miss one you will have to replay the entire level to get back to the section you needed. This can be a bit frustrating but it only happened to me once in my playthrough since I took my time.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The regular ending of the game was actually much more exciting than expected with the addition of Morpho Knight. A true dual of equals evocative of Meta Knight at the terminus of the dilapidated research lab with an excellent theme to boot. The fight is fun, fast, and quite different from the norm. This guy has a lot of moves just like meta knight, with some series debuts where he can start warping your screen if you get hit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Now with Morpho Knight revealed, the final evolution of certain copy abilities and the newly introduced Ranger Kirby are absolutely insane and a blast to play with. Dragon Fire Kirby is a powerhouse that can absolutely melt through bosses, Space Ranger Kirby&rsquo;s charged attack launches a massive energy ball that hit-stuns enemies, and Morpho Sword Kirby is probably one of the coolest movesets Kirby has ever gotten access to. Maxing these abilities to +2 power is a great use of your post-game rare stones and will equip you well for the final challenge</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As is tradition of every Kirby game, the true ending is guarded by the true final boss which sits at the end of a gauntlet consisting of every boss in the game. Now Kirby games are generally on the easy side, and this game was no exception. However, Chaos Elfilis is genuinely difficult; this fight poses a fun challenge packed with cinematic moves and some nostalgic behavior. The final sequence where Kirby mouthful modes onto a semi-truck and drives up falling meteors to ram into god was an amazingly funny and hype moment with a great remix of the main theme and ending the game with a bang.</span></p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>I&rsquo;d say that this is the best Kirby game in recent years where the jump to 3D along with some major changes to progression both in and out of levels have landed in a brilliant way. As with many Kirby games you can play this one nice and relaxed (for the most part) while enjoying an entertaining experience alongside all the cuteness that Kirby brings. Top that off with a soundtrack more than worthy of the franchise and you&rsquo;ve got a very solid game here, poyo poyo!</p>
