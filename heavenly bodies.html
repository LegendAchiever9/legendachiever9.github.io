                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Mission control has a task list for your expedition team&rsquo;s space voyage, the only problem is you&rsquo;ll have to maneuver all of your limbs independently from one another. Join your friends in this goofy physics simulator as you slowly get your zero gravity bearings, complete jobs around the station, and eventually make your return back to Earth.</span></p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section for Content -->
            <section id="content">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >There are seven levels throughout the game that will have you perform various tasks around the space station. The presentation of these missions is quite interesting: you have an in-game journal with diagrams and annotations about how to complete each objective. This turns the start of each mission into a group planning session where your group will need to decipher the plans to discover how to accomplish your goals. This is quite fun and adds to the immersion of actually being a member of a space expedition; I would definitely enjoy it if more games took the approach of having you learn in this way, though it is a difficult line to execute.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The biggest callout to make for this game is the control scheme which differs greatly when compared to the normal paradigm of controlling your character directly. In Heavenly Bodies you can only control your character&rsquo;s limbs: you&rsquo;ll have independent access to your astronaut&rsquo;s arms, hand, legs, and knees. As a result, you&rsquo;ll need to get used to propelling yourself throughout the zero gravity space station while grabbing onto railings, tubes, tennis racquets, and teammates. This immediately changes the entire focus of the game towards how you navigate this intentionally unintuitive setup relative to what games are normally like. Simply going from one end of the ship to another can be an entire ordeal depending on how comfortable you get with these controls. This also helps push the game towards a realistic feel: even simple tasks in space can feel more difficult and doing a space walk suddenly has much more impactful consequences if you slip up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >To make it a bit more forgiving, the &ldquo;Standard Mode&rdquo; of the game breaks the realism for a positive benefit: pointing your arms in a direction will give you just a pinch of acceleration such that you can &ldquo;swim&rdquo; through space even without bracing yourself. Especially if you&rsquo;re playing this with people who aren&rsquo;t accustomed to such high fidelity controls, this is an absolute lifesaver. However if you&rsquo;re feeling bold, the game also features &ldquo;Newtonian mode&rdquo; which throws all of those training wheels straight out the airlock. This harder difficulty fully removes the assisted velocity, forcing you to obey the laws of physics as they were written. This adds a whole new complexity to the game that makes a second playthrough feel all the more interesting by lowering your margin for error. If you accidentally get more speed than anticipated and haven&rsquo;t secured your safety tether, no amount of swimming will help you. These raised stakes can be super enjoyable and will certainly require you to embrace the cooperative nature of the game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >How could you be part of a successful space crew if you couldn&rsquo;t cooperate with your friends? Squad up with a group and enter this physics playground together, helping or hindering each other throughout each mission. Co-op definitely makes the moments in this game as you&rsquo;ll end up in crazy situations where excellent teamwork will leave lasting memories while chaotic anti-synergy will have everyone laughing. Your creativity is the only limit to the added benefit that co-op brings, as even the seemingly mundane task of passing a wrench to your fellow space cadet can turn into an epic basketball challenge if you choose to do so. Self imposed challenges and an abundance of interactive objects within each level provide the perfect foundation for you and your team to make magic as you (hopefully) make some progress in completing each mission.</span></p>

            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Inherent to this control scheme, similar to old school games like QWOP, is certainly some amount of frustration. In games we&rsquo;re used to controlling our character in the way that we want; the added layer of extraction in Heavenly Bodies removes some of this agency. This can take quite a bit of time to get used to and in the meantime, finding yourself unable to simply move forward isn&rsquo;t enjoyable. You&rsquo;ll definitely get used to it over time even if it requires some extra brain power, so this mostly serves as a warning to the initial difficulty curve of this experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay this may not apply to everyone, but my fingers cannot handle playing this game for very long. There are plenty of situations where you&rsquo;ll need to grip with both of your hands and holding that position for extended periods is not ideal (curse these small controllers). I wasn&rsquo;t the only one in my group who felt this so take this as a precaution, maybe go one level at a time. Overall the controls are the only real potential limitation I&rsquo;ll throw at this game, but as you get used to it you&rsquo;ll find plenty of enjoyment.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Music -->
            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >We&rsquo;re rocking a fully atmospheric soundtrack for this game where the music takes a backseat in order to let individual moments capture you. Unobtrusive synths with hardly any melody get played in long tones to provide an aura of serenity which is greatly welcome when the gameplay and controls enforce anything but. Chimes, whistles, beeps and whirs will also occasionally make their way into the track as you progress through each level which provides enough diversity to keep you honed in without becoming overbearing. Very precise sound design also goes a long way to flavor the soundtrack: opening of a latch, releasing a gas valve, the whine of an antenna signal, and the grinding gear of a crane nest themselves effortlessly in the spacious audio channel set for you in the game to craft a more holistic and engaging experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Main Menu&rdquo; has repeated bass synth patterns while light, ethereal synths float over the top. &ldquo;Mission Control&rdquo; is the level select screen which inverts that which we heard before: we have a repeated ostinato from the higher synths while a bass takes center stage. The melody stays basically the same, only undergoing slight deviations whereas the pitch has a bit more liberty to move around and catch your ear. The track leaves plenty of room to breathe as you contemplate where to go next along your journey.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The structure of these two out of game pieces stays consistent throughout the remainder of the OST. Each song doesn&rsquo;t take up too much space, favoring short, repeated phrases that can be placed among longer sustained synths. This ensures a clean looping point depending on how long you mess around the level, while giving each level just enough feel to not be empty. The vacancy of space generally results in an uncluttered soundtrack that gives you room to think about the stars and about how you&rsquo;re going to move your hands.</span></p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >Aside from the difficulty, another gem of replayability and depth comes in the form of challenges found throughout each level. Most of the levels have three challenges, two of which are shared amongst all levels: complete the mission in Newtonian and bring back the hidden collectible. The latter involves you scouring each level for a hidden (but glowing) object in a potentially inconvenient location in order to eventually bring it back to mission control. This may take the form of requiring you to go out on a dicey spacewalk with one hand since the other is holding a shoe or having you worm your way through a tight ventilation shaft with a plunger attached to your belt. The third category of challenge which is unique to each level is in an initially unlisted objective that will only reveal itself when you complete a level for the first time. A few of these achievements do a great job at having you rethink your mission approach or morphing the gameplay from task completion to a scavenger hunt. &ldquo;Pry open the airlock door with a tennis racket&rdquo; is equal parts ridiculous and entertaining to execute on while &ldquo;Assemble and deploy the Space Telescope without using the crane arms&rdquo; completely changes the scope and completion method of the level. These are great ways to encourage you and your cooperative teammates to play with the systems at your disposal and naturally create more memorable moments together.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Speaking of memorable moments, this game is full of them before even considering the fact that you are paired with other people. The dangers of operating an airlock, a rogue power outage, or piloting a probe with way too strong thrusters all shape an environment that allows your creativity and teamwork to shine. The reasonable scientific accuracy mixed with absurd situations and nonstandard controls congregate into a mixture that facilitates genuinely fun-filled missions that will have you looking forward to what comes next.</span></p>
