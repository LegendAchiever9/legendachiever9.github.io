                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Mission control has a task list for your expedition team&rsquo;s space voyage, the only problem is you&rsquo;ll have to maneuver all of your limbs independently from one another. Join your friends in this goofy physics simulator as you slowly get your zero gravity bearings, complete jobs around the station, and eventually make your return back to Earth.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Content -->
            <section id="content">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >There are seven levels throughout the game that will have you perform various tasks around the space station. The presentation of these missions is quite interesting: you have an in-game journal with diagrams and annotations about how to complete each objective. This turns the start of each mission into a group planning session where your group will need to decipher the plans to discover how to accomplish your goals. This is quite fun and adds to the immersion of actually being a member of a space expedition; I would definitely enjoy it if more games took the approach of having you learn in this way, though it is a difficult line to execute.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The biggest callout to make for this game is the control scheme which differs greatly when compared to the normal paradigm of controlling your character directly. In Heavenly Bodies you can only control your character&rsquo;s limbs: you&rsquo;ll have independent access to your astronaut&rsquo;s arms, hand, legs, and knees. As a result, you&rsquo;ll need to get used to propelling yourself throughout the zero gravity space station while grabbing onto railings, tubes, tennis racquets, and teammates. This immediately changes the entire focus of the game towards how you navigate this intentionally unintuitive setup relative to what games are normally like. Simply going from one end of the ship to another can be an entire ordeal depending on how comfortable you get with these controls. This also helps push the game towards a realistic feel: even simple tasks in space can feel more difficult and doing a space walk suddenly has much more impactful consequences if you slip up.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >To make it a bit more forgiving, the &ldquo;Standard Mode&rdquo; of the game breaks the realism for a positive benefit: pointing your arms in a direction will give you just a pinch of acceleration such that you can &ldquo;swim&rdquo; through space even without bracing yourself. Especially if you&rsquo;re playing this with people who aren&rsquo;t accustomed to such high fidelity controls, this is an absolute lifesaver. However if you&rsquo;re feeling bold, the game also features &ldquo;Newtonian mode&rdquo; which throws all of those training wheels straight out the airlock. This harder difficulty fully removes the assisted velocity, forcing you to obey the laws of physics as they were written. This adds a whole new complexity to the game that makes a second playthrough feel all the more interesting by lowering your margin for error. If you accidentally get more speed than anticipated and haven&rsquo;t secured your safety tether, no amount of swimming will help you. These raised stakes can be super enjoyable and will certainly require you to embrace the cooperative nature of the game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >How could you be part of a successful space crew if you couldn&rsquo;t cooperate with your friends? Squad up with a group and enter this physics playground together, helping or hindering each other throughout each mission. Co-op definitely makes the moments in this game as you&rsquo;ll end up in crazy situations where excellent teamwork will leave lasting memories while chaotic anti-synergy will have everyone laughing. Your creativity is the only limit to the added benefit that co-op brings, as even the seemingly mundane task of passing a wrench to your fellow space cadet can turn into an epic basketball challenge if you choose to do so. Self imposed challenges and an abundance of interactive objects within each level provide the perfect foundation for you and your team to make magic as you (hopefully) make some progress in completing each mission.</span></p>

            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Inherent to this control scheme, similar to old school games like QWOP, is certainly some amount of frustration. In games we&rsquo;re used to controlling our character in the way that we want; the added layer of extraction in Heavenly Bodies removes some of this agency. This can take quite a bit of time to get used to and in the meantime, finding yourself unable to simply move forward isn&rsquo;t enjoyable. You&rsquo;ll definitely get used to it over time even if it requires some extra brain power, so this mostly serves as a warning to the initial difficulty curve of this experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay this may not apply to everyone, but my fingers cannot take playing this game for very long. There are plenty of situations where you&rsquo;ll need to grip with both of your hands and holding that position for extended periods is not ideal (curse these small controllers). I wasn&rsquo;t the only one in my group who felt this so take this as a precaution, maybe go one level at a time. Overall the controls are the only real potential limitation I&rsquo;ll throw at this game, but as you get used to it you&rsquo;ll find plenty of enjoyment.</span></p>
