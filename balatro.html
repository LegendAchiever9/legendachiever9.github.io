                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >This is a deckbuilding roguelite that embraces the core elements of the genre: simple and easy to learn mechanics where your choices are the main factor in determining whether or not you&rsquo;ll emerge victorious. Perhaps the most satisfying sound design a game can have, combined with a relaxing but funky soundtrack and no wonder this game was able to dethrone Minecraft as top game on the app store for a few weeks.</span></p>

                <p>A roguelite where you score poker hands looks boring on the surface but Balatro takes that challenge and delivers in spades (get it?). The concept is simple: play cards that would score as a poker hand, add them up and multiply by the strength of the hand. Beat the score posted by the &ldquo;blind&rdquo; and move on to the next one; though you may wonder how one poker hand can get you to a score of 100,000 chips? That&rsquo;s where the game stakes its claim at uniqueness, as the elegant and easily understandable core mechanic is the addition of Jokers that can modify your score. 150 Jokers randomly offered to you in shops that occur between rounds take on a wide variety of forms with clever innovative designs. Piece them together to form synergies that let take your score higher than you can imagine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As if the game didn&rsquo;t create a system engaging and satisfying enough, the deck manipulation aspect of the game is done by opening card packs. Arcana packs hold tarot cards that will shape your deck, spectral packs have strong effects with a twist, celestial packs let you improve the power of your poker hands, and buffoon packs let you pick new jokers to buff out your strategy. It&rsquo;s obvious to say, but using the thrill of opening a booster pack as the core way to get stronger is brilliant and lends to the simple yet hyper-engaging design of the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game is divided into rounds called &ldquo;antes&rdquo;, each of which culminating with a &ldquo;boss blind&rdquo;. These have a chip requirement as other rounds do but there are 28 different effects that can occur. These range from discarding random cards to disabling entire suits; scouting ahead becomes pivotal in the later stages to not have your run abruptly hit a wall. If you manage to conquer 8 antes you win! Then you can enter endless mode where you attempt to inflate your score as high as you can before the chip requirement becomes too much for your deck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game also has some macro level features like economy based on round performance and tags for skipping blinds. Each ante has 2 blinds and a boss blind; for each blind you have a number of hands and discards. Discards let you cycle cards out of your hand, while hands define how many times you can score&nbsp; a poker hand to attempt the chip total of the blind. You&rsquo;ll get one extra income per hand remaining at the end of a round, so use those discards in order to save hands and earn more money! There is also interest, where every multiple of five you passive gain one extra income as well. On the topic of tags, each blind (except the boss blind) also has the option to be skipped. Doing so will net you one of 24 &ldquo;tags&rdquo; that each have a unique effect: like immediately opening a booster pack or turning one joker in the next shop to a &ldquo;rare&rdquo; quality. Finally you can also pick your starting deck from 15 options that range from standard to wacky in their compositions and abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main difficulty modifier of the game is stakes, not only increase the chip requirements for each blind but also present an additional drawback, such as reduced hand size or deck size. Once you beat one stake you unlock the next one, going from the default white stake all the way up to gold. The game also has a challenge mode, where several different twists on the game rules will challenge you to complete a run with five eggs, or even with no jokers at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of these elements come together to form a streamlined experience that has a solid amount of replayability. Try out new decks with their own perks or up the difficulty to test your strategies. Pick new jokers to build a deck around and see just how many chips you can rack up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From an aesthetic perfective, the game has a hypnotic visual and sound design. Shuffling of cards, scoring a hand, ringing up your point total, and summing your earnings at the end of a blind are all innately satisfying by design and urge you to keep going. The visuals are simple but charming with the main highlight being the unique art of each joker, many of which contain jokes or references to pop cultures.</p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p>There really isn&rsquo;t much to say here without some setup, so here we go: there are two types of players based on what their respective goals are: those who aim to beat Ante 8 and those who aim to reach a high score. If you find yourself in the first category, there isn&rsquo;t much negative to say. The depth is sufficient for high replayability, unlocking different vouchers and jokers will have you playing different styles, and every run is winnable if you play flexibly based on what you get.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a high score hunter as indicated in the latter category, the game can become frustrating due to the restricted nature of decks that can feasibly make it to the deeper point of the game. Given that what you find in a run is random, waiting for the perfect seed that allows you to shoot for the moon transforms the game from casual, quick, and fun to tedious and slow. The game has strong enough legs to support this style for a while, but eventually it will run out of steam especially when compared to the depth of games like Slay the Spire. There isn&rsquo;t too much under the hood of the game that enables this, though you&rsquo;ll definitely get quite a few awesome runs in your normal playtime that reach this upper echelon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One smaller negative is on the completionist front for similar reasons to above with one key difference. Not every joker is randomly offered; certain jokers that have a requirement to unlock may require you to fulfill certain conditions before the game will offer it to you. That in addition to a special league of jokers that I&rsquo;ll discuss after the point of no return can make finding every joker and voucher a bit painful, especially if you&rsquo;re trying to achieve a high score beyond Ante 8. That being said, the natural exploration of the content that occurs throughout the game will get you quite far with respect to collecting every card, so overall it isn&rsquo;t a big issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Final nitpick is that having to unlock each stake for every deck independent of one another takes a long time, and since each of these will require more run restarts than the last it can become a grind quite quickly. I personally would have preferred to have this be a uniform unlock.</p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >There is actually only 1 piece in the OST, the main theme. It&rsquo;s risky to have a 4 minute track loop endlessly during a game so if you opt into this paradigm it better be incredible. There are, however, a few variations that are adaptive to which game screen you&rsquo;re currently on: gameplay, shop, arcana pack, celestial pack, and boss blind. While they are different, the main elements that change are instrumentation and which pitches are emphasized. So though a notable switch-up, it still boils down to that main theme needing to be of exceedingly high quality. And what do you know, sometimes you just find a composer on Fiverr who makes light work of this normally difficult challenge and delivers an incredible track that does indeed hold up no matter how long you listen to it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The music is mellow, ethereal, funky, and even hypnotic; the trance-like state that this song evokes might even prevent you from realizing that the track is only 4 minutes long. This track has an unconventional time signature, holding a steady 7/4 for the entire duration. 7/4 isn&rsquo;t anything new and generally has a feeling of being odd, jazzy, or askew: it&rsquo;s all over the place from rock like The Beatles and the Eagles to video games in some of the Minecraft OST pieces. Normally, complex time signatures try to emphasize some abnormality by virtue of being strong attention grabbers. This track does none of that; in fact it might be the most seamless 7/4 I&rsquo;ve ever heard. It subconsciously keeps your ears tuned in and listening while being a relaxing and soothing background to the gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Further working to keep you interested in listening to this track for potentially hundreds of hours is the arrangement. Right off the bat we have electric piano chords on the beat immediately switching to syncopating to establish our jazzy vibe. An electric bass brings the funk, while synthesized wispy chords lend to the otherworldly feeling of this song. Our lead is a keytar with heavy pitch modulation (vibrato, for you musicians) which plays a slow but enticing melody filled with exciting improv-inspired runs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As for the composition, we&rsquo;ve got plenty of repeated lines to grab your attention filled with slight variations that keep it continuously interesting to listen to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >In the first Section, we have an electric piano opener on loop to set the mood</span> <span >before letting the full instrumentation come in. The second section plays the melody and loops it twice. On the third loop, we change up the notes a bit and add in some harmonies. On the fourth loop, add in a few more harmonies and pitch up a few more notes on the back half of each phrase.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Third section kicks off with ascending eighth notes on the scale for three loops. We then repeat this phrase but let our lead keytar layer on top of this. After that you hear a staggered note pattern up and then down the scale, before resuming the original ascending pattern. The fourth section (our bridge) has the drums take the forefront. Afterwards we only keep the piano, chords, and bassline but drop them to the background.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The fifth section gets us back to our normal sound balance but lets the keytar shine and play some fun runs, then getting us some genuine improv time for the keytar! The sixth section and final section of the main track again brings the ascending notes on the scale for three loops. Do one more loop but have the notes descend, then one more loop with conviction &mdash; more ascending notes for three loops. To top it all off there is one more loop but with repeated alternating notes for finality.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >All of this results in a track that you will not get tired of no matter how much you listen to it. It&rsquo;s infectious, mesmerizing, and calming all at the same time. It&rsquo;s interesting but not invasive as it lets the rest of the game do the talking. Even though the game awards orchestral arrangement of this theme is not actually in the game, I&rsquo;m going to pick it for my song of the game anyway, since I can. Go listen to it!</span></p>

                    <p><span >Pretty much the only spoil-able thing in this game is the existence of legendary jokers. There are five of these clowns </span><span >&mdash; </span><span >literally, they&rsquo;re all famous jesters from history &mdash; which all (except 1) have very powerful effects. However, the only way to get these is by finding a &ldquo;The Soul&rdquo; card, which has a 0.3% chance of replacing a card in any arcana or spectral pack. Suffice it to say that if you&rsquo;re looking for a specific one of these, it will take a large swathe of runs to actually discover all five of these. The moment where you first find &ldquo;The Soul&rdquo; is special and was a very enjoyable reveal for me. The design, main loop, and presentation of this game just gets you so excited, very well done.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Let&rsquo;s return to our discussion on replayability and run viability, especially for the high score chasing player archetype. If you&rsquo;re shooting for a scientific notation score or anything past Ante 12, the freedom of choice and diversity of viable strategies collapses. You&rsquo;ll need to have some pretty specific jokers as well as a hyper-tailored deck to make this possible. Given the random nature of the game and the fact that some of these setups </span><em><span >require</span></em><span > a legendary joker, it will require many, many resets to make this happen. So much so that it can certainly take some of the magic out of the game so I would not recommend going for this for too long. But hey maybe the payout of those massive numbers going ding-ding-ding is worth it and that&rsquo;s totally cool, it is quite a cathartic moment. My best run was actually the same one where I unlocked my final legendary joker, Triboulet, so having it all coalesce in one run was quite a memorable experience (I jumped for joy when I found him).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For the completionists out there, I cannot recommend going for a gold sticker on every joker. Not to say it won&rsquo;t be enjoyable, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t what I&rsquo;m looking for in the game. Just the randomness alone is enough for me to not want to subject myself to this endeavor.</span></p>

                <p><span >If Slay the Spire is the best deckbuilding roguelite of all time, then Balatro is the best deckbuilding roguelite of today. Incredibly quick to pick up, stellar sound design, a gripping soundtrack, this is a dangerously satisfying game to play. One run turns to ten as you chase that high score earning deck. The game systems don&rsquo;t go that deep but if you&rsquo;re looking for fast run times and simple yet addictive gameplay, this is where it&rsquo;s at.</span></p>
