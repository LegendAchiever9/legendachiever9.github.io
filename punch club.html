                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Follow in your father&rsquo;s footsteps as a professional fighter in this pixel art resource management life simulator. Train your stats to get stronger, work your day job to earn enough money for food, and enter fighting tournaments while still leaving enough time in the day to engage with wacky characters and events across the city.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span >The core gameplay loop here consists of managing your combat stats, food, energy, and time to prepare for fighting matches that will progress the story. You&rsquo;ll need money to afford food and sleep to have enough energy to train your stats up. At the end of each day your stats will go down so you&rsquo;ll be in a consistent balancing act of exploring the city and getting those workout repetitions in.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >You&rsquo;ll meet plenty of characters throughout your journey that range from a definitely normal pizza shop owner to the mafia don of the city. Others will help you train, give you a job, or offer questionable choices that can impact the path you take throughout the game. These manifest in the form of various questlines that you&rsquo;ll be able to weave into your planned training routine. While the story is nothing to write home about, there are plenty of funny moments and interactions that will keep your time with the characters charming and enjoyable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Your trained stats aren&rsquo;t the primary way to gain combat power, instead your equipped skills and fighting style will determine how to play. Early on you&rsquo;ll have the choice between the Way of the Tiger, Way of the Turtle, and Way of the Bear. Each of these present different playstyles and skills to help you in your journey. The fights themselves are essentially fully automated, with breaks between combat rounds giving you time to analyze the situation and alter your loadout. You&rsquo;ll be able to see your upcoming opponent&rsquo;s stats ahead of time to help you plan out an efficient schedule culminating with a victory in battle.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Depending on your chosen fighting style some fights have a relatively narrow win condition that more or less requires a specific skill to beat. Skill points scale up in cost as you progress, so even trying to acquire a basic skill from another fighting style may require a significant investment. As a result, you don&rsquo;t have too much room to experiment within one playthrough and if you find yourself without an important skill it can take a while to farm up for it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >While you can&rsquo;t really end up softlocked, there are points at which you may need to grind through many days to recuperate a loss of stats or money. Losing fights will generally give you an injury that you need to spend multiple days recovering from while also hampering your stat growth. This slows you down and can feel annoying, but overall it&rsquo;s not the end of the world when it happens.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >For a game with less than 10 songs on the soundtrack, this game has some really nice 8-bit tunes to listen to. Since most of the gameplay revolves around repeating tasks while you train and work your way up the&nbsp; fight chain, you&rsquo;ll spend a lot of time with the same track looping. That being said, these songs hold up and are great fuel to keep you going. First up is the exception to that rule, &ldquo;Menu Song&rdquo;, which plays during the pause menu. This song has no right to be so much fun, it always puts a smile on my face and will have you pausing more often just to jam out. The cheery synths, layered harmonies and playful rhythms keep this tune interesting to listen to at all points and is a surprising but welcome addition to the OST.</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >The songs in this game definitely take inspiration from the Street Fighter series and &ldquo;Main Theme&rdquo; is a prime example. By far the track you&rsquo;ll listen to most throughout your journey, the two-note percussion made up of white noise and driving eighth notes reminiscent of Rocky keep you moving. At 1:27 the piece really comes into its own by taking the repeated eighth note line and dropping it to the background as a harmony while a new synth takes over the melody. Layering is a key element of music and this cannot be more true in the 8-bit style where you don&rsquo;t have enough depth to make the sounds themselves interesting. This whole track makes great use of layers just like the menu theme from before in addition to some other fun additions like the glissando at 1:40.</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >The other core piece in the game is of course &ldquo;Battle&rdquo; which you&rsquo;ll hear (almost) every time you enter a fight. A single pitch repeated in 32nd notes makes up our percussion and one other track is allocated to the bass which also pushes the song forwards in a 16th note pattern. At 0:34 we add another synth in an eighth note pattern to bolster our rhythmic layering, where each element of the track gets played at different subdivisions of the measure (32nd, 16th, and 8th so far). This keeps up for a while until 1:05 where a nasty solo rhythm comes in, and then again repeated an octave up in harmony. This completely breaks any repetition that was creeping up in the piece and catches your full attention. Afterwards all instruments completely drop out for a bridge in the bass and then lead synth; before you know it we start driving again and we&rsquo;re back in business!</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >&ldquo;Prison&rdquo; is the track that replaces the main theme once you get to the late game of the &ldquo;evil&rdquo; story path and it absolutely delivers. Crank the influence from Street Fighter up to eleven since this piece will never fail to give you some motivation. The track slows out slow and steady with the classic 8-bit percussion technique used throughout the soundtrack, a simple bassline, and a soft, moving synth to carry the melody. 0:40 is where it all kicks up to the melody that you&rsquo;ll keep humming even after you close the game. After the break at 1:07 we have a lower pitched synth take a different melody to help mix things up. Everything ramps back up to 1:58 where the fast moving melody will surely get you off your chair to do at least 10 push ups.</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >Overall, the game does a really nice job at creating simple loops to repeat during gameplay but keeping them engaging for the player. Repetitive tasks and music would eventually bog down the game but through creative layering and efficient use of the 8-bit tracks you actually end up with a really engaging soundtrack to accompany your journey to become the ultimate fighter.</span></p>

                    <p><span >At some point during the game you&rsquo;ll have done way too many pizza deliveries for your own good and you&rsquo;ll be offered a &ldquo;special&rdquo; pizza order. You may think you know what&rsquo;s being offered to you but little do you know this is actually the way to access the Teenage Mutant Ninja Gators questline where you go into the sewers and battle four nina gators to meet with Master Raccoon &mdash; it&rsquo;s all based on a true story. It was really this moment that let me know that Punch Club wasn&rsquo;t afraid to not take itself seriously, and what a good decision that was. The game allows itself to be goofy and silly and really relish in the ridiculous, superhero coded adventure that they want the player to experience. This is one of many wacky character questlines that you&rsquo;ll pursue in order to see what insane situation they&rsquo;ll throw you in next. This game quotes Star Wars (so you already know I&rsquo;m a fan), but even more so is filled with tons of pop culture references ranging from Rocky and the Simpsons to Pulp Fiction and Marvel comics.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As I mentioned before there are two story paths in the game depending on your choices. You can master the underground fighting ring and live a life of crime with the Don, or be a noble vigilante and live the high life under a famous movie producer. I ended up doing two playthroughs to see both choices play out and give myself an opportunity to experience a different fighting style. While the story beats, setting, and music beats are different the actual gameplay doesn&rsquo;t change too much between the options, but it was certainly fun to do (albeit a few years apart) and enjoyable both times!</span></p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p><span >If you&rsquo;re looking for a light resource management game with some fun references to movies, TV, and comics alongside an energetic 8-bit sound track then I&rsquo;d definitely recommend Punch Club! It isn&rsquo;t the deepest game and there are a few rough edges, but for the most part you&rsquo;ve got an engaging combat system and a wide cast of silly characters and quests to experience. It&rsquo;s a great chill game and will certainly make you smile and maybe even dance a little.</span></p>
