                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Slay the Spire is the modern era pioneer of roguelite deckbuilders. Not only did this game put the genre on the map in a big way, but also set the gold standard of what good design looks like. A simple but tight core combat system with multiple characters, plenty of viable builds, and an adjustable challenge curve makes this one of the highest replayability games out there.</span></p>

                <p><span >The gameplay loop is simple: draw cards from your deck and use them to kill the monsters on the other side of the field before you run out of health. You&rsquo;ll face multiple encounters on a randomized map with brief respites in between to heal, take a risk on in-game events, and shop for new cards and consumables.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Four different characters are available to play with significantly different playstyles and cards. All of them are completely feasible for making deep runs into the game so it mostly comes down to personal preference on which class you prefer to play most. Within each class there are different deck strategies you can pursue, making each run a test of your flexibility in playing what is offered.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For the gameplay, the main unique system is on the less intuitive side in that any cards from your hand that you don&rsquo;t play are moved to your discard pile at the end of your turn. Your discard pile will likely get reshuffled into the draw pile for long combats, but the inability to hold onto cards for another turn is a key element to plan around. Another distinguishing factor of the combat is knowing exactly what the enemies will do. The intent system shows whether the enemy monsters are planning to defend, buff, or attack; in the latter case, they will display precisely how much damage they will deal. As a result, you&rsquo;re heavily incentivized to take your time and formulate a plan. Calculate your actions along with the intent of enemies to efficiently pass through each combat while taking minimal damage.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There is a small macro element where you choose which encounter to face next in the form of a map with diverging and converging paths. Do you choose an elite enemy to fight because of two chests behind it? Or do you face three smaller fights because the shop might contain a key card to unlock your deck&rsquo;s full potential? This second layer of strategy can also be optimized to help extract the most power out of every run. Getting stronger consists of obtaining relics that provide powerful buffs throughout your run, upgrading specific cards to enhance their effects, and of course adding new cards to your deck. Combine this with curses that hinder you which may arise as a consequence from obtaining a powerful item and you have a pretty complex choice system which can make or break your run.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >The only real weak points if you were to actively look for any don&rsquo;t lie in any aspect of the gameplay. The visuals and storytelling are by no means bad, but they don&rsquo;t shine in any strong ways. I personally find that this does not detract from the game at all, but if those are elements that appeal to you more strongly, bear this in mind.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span >The only other warning I can give is that the game is difficult, especially as you scale the mastery curve. Getting into the upper echelons that the game provides is no meager task and is entirely reliant on how well you learn and think through your strategy. There is some inherent randomness due to the genre, but you generally have enough agency to adapt to and overcome this obstacle.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >You&rsquo;ll be spending lots of time in areas with the same songs so having musical variation is essential. Many of the pieces mix up the rhythms to help keep you interested and engaged. Each act theme holds repeated musical ideas with small variations which results in a pretty compelling soundtrack to accompany your ascent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >From an instrumentation standpoint, the low strings are used to establish an impactful bassline that drives the piece forward. Grandiose horns set a regal yet foreboding intensity and also serve as accent hits for stronger moments. High strings frequently take the melody, though occasionally woodwinds are used as well for a softer, floating sound. As you listen, notice how the low strings are used to march forward while high strings either keep fast repeated notes to drive or take the melody with long tenuto notes. Similarly the woodwinds can come in as bouncy or high flying lyrical lines. The horns may be regal and magnificent at one moment, followed by intimidating and forewarning at the next.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >These principles can best be heard in the Act I and Act II themes, &ldquo;Exordium&rdquo; and &ldquo;The City&rdquo;, respectively. In &ldquo;Exordium&rdquo; we start out with the low and high strings playing a central motif. The horns then take a haunting melody line over top ast 0:12 while the basses keep the motif line moving. At 0:37 we take a variation of the motif which transfers us to a dark but lovely melody played over top. From 1:27 to 1:39 we have a slight but really interesting change in the motif in the strings that again leads into a bridge of groaning, sustained harmonies in the strings. At 2:02 our motif is back with a strange electric harp played in the background. The strings then take a full reprise of our motif and use it as the melody for that section.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >In &ldquo;The City&rdquo; the motif once again gets established straight away. A lilting and somewhat playful melody comes from the woodwinds. At 0:09 the strings take the lead but the motif stays; at 0:28 the motif is doubled by a flute as well. At 1:02, the brasses take the motif, echoed by the strings with a variation in the notes. Then at 2:00 we have somewhat of a reprise of that first idea, but in a more bumbling and menacing tone from the strings and doubled by oboe. 2:35 then brings us back to the motif as original played as the string melody takes a more tragic tone; at 2:45 the bassoon takes the motif with the strings and switches it up again. 3:13 then takes the motif and breaks it down into a threatening march as we close out the loop.</span></p>

                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>&ldquo;Mind Bloom&rdquo; is the song that plays during the event of the same name during Act 3 of a run. If you select the &ldquo;I am War&rdquo; option, you will fight a random boss from Act I. While it&rsquo;s a decent gameplay element that really emphasizes how much stronger you&rsquo;ve become as you demolish a previously challenging foe, the more impactful effect here comes from the music. We get a warped and much darker version of &ldquo;Exordium&rdquo; which is fitting as the Act I theme. Guttural chants and the drone of brass with low strings immediately set the tone and pave the way for the strings and accented brass to come in. 0:45 brings in a suspenseful string beat with a dynamic cello driving us forward. This line directly parallels the high strings playing this tune in the Act 1 theme. The brass accents as well are in the same place but with a lot more force and cleanliness during Act 1 as opposed to this theme where they have a twisted, muddier sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Heart&rdquo; kicks off with a bang, what an entrance for a final boss tune. Harsh accented quarter notes from the brass while repeated low brass eighth notes up the ante. A trumpet melody takes the lead with a melody that sounds like a being fallen from grace. An expressive and ghostly female vocal joins in here which adds great texture to the melody. 0:59 brings in male tenor voices for our main theme which is grand and evokes a sense of finality as you brave the final fight in the hidden Act IV. Pair this with a deep heartbeat sound effect that is completely off rhythm and add an element of chaos and desperation to this beautifully tragic theme. The final repetition of the melody adds in a flute countermelody as well as a modulated variation on the motif previously established, great stuff.</p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >On the topic of Act IV, it&rsquo;s a bit hidden and contrived to reach. After winning a run with the first three characters, you&rsquo;ll then have the ability to find the keys which unlock the final act. Those keys are obtainable by making specific choices throughout your run: selecting recall while at a rest site, killing a buffed elite (one spawns each run and is engulfed in flames on the map), and selecting the key instead of the relic contained in a treasure room chest. Once you acquire all keys in a run and defeat Act III, you&rsquo;ll move into Act IV which has a challenging elite battle and the final boss with a theme of the same name, &ldquo;The Heart&rdquo;. This is a brutal fight that will put your deck and wits to the test though is both rewarding and satisfying once you&rsquo;re able to conquer it. Worth noting that this challenge is completely optional, it&rsquo;s up to you whether you&rsquo;d like to engage with this fight or not in each run.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The main form of difficulty scaling in the game happens through the ascension system. Whenever you complete a run by killing the Act III boss (Act IV is optional), you&rsquo;ll unlock an ascension level. These range from 1-20 and modify the game to be more difficult: whether that be spawning more elite enemies, increasing enemy damage, or even burdening you with a curse. Moving up the ascension ranks is a great way to test your mettle and improve your skills if you&rsquo;re interested in diving deeper into the game. It&rsquo;s completely optional and if you hit your limit there isn&rsquo;t any pressure or incentive (other than internal motivation) to continue to higher levels. Besting Ascension level 20 is a grueling task that demands excellent planning and strategy, but is incredibly rewarding for those who reach this pinnacle.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As a testament to the robust design, high caliber players are able to somewhat consistently complete A20 runs, some even boasting a completion rate of 50% or higher. This helps show that even though there are many random elements to each run, your proficiency, adaptability, and execution are the primary drivers to success. Your fate is in your own hands as you strive to master any obstacle the game throws at you.</span></p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p><span >Slay the Spire is the progenitor of the genre for good reason: the mechanics are elegant but retain depth, viable deck synergies are plentiful yet easy to grasp, and the playable characters are distinct yet feel uniquely powerful. Your mastery of the game is rewarded and the difficulty scaling allows you to progress in the way you want. Tried and true, old but gold, a classic; whatever you call it, this is the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of the genre so get in there and see for yourself why this titan remains on top.</span></p>
