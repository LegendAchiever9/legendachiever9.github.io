                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >The ape is back in one of the best 2D platformers of today: run, jump, roll, climb, and swing your way through beautifully crafted levels that seamlessly incorporate the environment into the gameplay. Top it all off with the return of David Wise for another masterpiece soundtrack and you&rsquo;ve got a phenomenal experience that will truly test your platforming chops.</span></p>

                <p><span >The gameplay from </span><em><span >Donkey Kong Country Returns</span></em><span > is back in all of its glory! Pilot DK through spectacularly imaginative levels that will test your precision and control. Donkey Kong feels as weighty as ever and this momentum certainly provides a challenge when you&rsquo;re balancing on precarious ledges terrain that gets destroyed as you hop across it. DK doesn&rsquo;t lack in mobility however, as the ability to roll at any instant and cancel it with a jump (even midair) turns every level into a playground ripe for experimentation. Take your time with calculated leaps as you assess your surroundings or bolt ahead with rolling jumps and let your reflexes take the wheel. The surface level looseness presents quite the steep learning curve, but as you progress further throughout the game your mastery over the movement will grow to the point where you&rsquo;ll bound past obstacles with immense satisfaction. In order to provide an extra layer of control, your old (but younger) and faithful companion Diddy Kong is back with his rocketbarrel jetpack &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be able to append each of your jumps with a brief hover as you make slight adjustments to stick the landing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Tropical Freeze isn&rsquo;t without its new additions though, as there are quite a few changes to the gameplay mechanics. Firstly, Diddy Kong isn&rsquo;t the only character to assist you on your journey, both Cranky Kong and Dixie Kong join the fray with unique abilities to augment your platforming. Cranky makes use of his signature cane as a pogo stick to enable the pair to jump to greater heights while bouncing straight over spiked floors and enemies. Dixie on the other hand whips her ponytail at rapid speeds to grant DK some extra lift at the end a jump or even help propel the duo past rapid currents that are otherwise untraversable. Speaking of underwater segments, the game adds a breath meter for the first time in the series. While not a new concept in platformers, this enables the level designs to focus more on labyrinthian navigation or tense escapes when the time is right. Another change in this iteration of the series is that grabbing vines is no longer automation, you&rsquo;ll have to actively hold down the button to grab, providing enhanced control but also requiring more dexterity as you swing from hanging vegetation or climb inverted surfaces. Lastly, DK now has the ability to pluck objects rooted in the ground &mdash; this adds a new element to the stages as well as an additional way to hide one of the hallmarks of DKC games: collectibles</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >It wouldn&rsquo;t be a Donkey Kong game without collectibles and Tropical Freeze has no shortage. You&rsquo;ve got bananas, balloons, banana coins, puzzle pieces, KONG letters, and even gacha figurines to collect. Bananas are strewn about each level and for every one hundred that you collect you&rsquo;ll earn an extra life balloon. The bananas are generally placed to follow the intended platforming path, show routes to different secrets, or as part of a mini challenge for another collectible. They effectively serve as your guide throughout each level and also act as your passive method of farming new lives.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The active way you&rsquo;ll acquire more lives is by visiting Funky Kong&rsquo;s shop where you&rsquo;ll spend banana coins for various different items. Different balloons for more lives or saving a missed jump, recruiting Squawks the Parrot for finding collectibles, assisting character barrels, and various power ups populate the shop inventory to aid in your adventure. Having a surplus of banana coins is always handy to give you that extra nudge when you encounter difficult levels and fortunately you&rsquo;ll find plenty throughout your adventures.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The next collectibles we&rsquo;ll discuss are puzzle pieces and KONG letters which act as the side objectives of each level. There are several pieces throughout every stage hidden in a variety of ways such as grabbing every banana in a sequence, secrets in the environment, mini objectives, and of course bonus rooms. This literal treasure hunt will have you looking closely at the details of each level &mdash; which are so detailed and tell a lovely story through the environment alone &mdash; in order to find well placed jigsaw pieces that are a joy to collect. We&rsquo;ll discuss these a bit more later in the spoiler section if you&rsquo;re keen on knowing the reward for amassing this pictorial panoply.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Next up is a series staple, the KONG letters: this challenge requires you to amass the letters that spell KONG in each stage. These letters are always on screen somewhere, even if cleverly placed behind the foreground or off the beaten path. If you&rsquo;re able to collect all four of them in one run through of a level and do that for every level in a world your prize will await you, but we&rsquo;ll talk about that after the point of no return.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The final adornment is none other than Nintendo gacha figurines that you can acquire by purchasing random capsules from Funky&rsquo;s shop. There are forty of these to collect (not exactly but you&rsquo;ll see) purely for the fun of the chase and can be a nice side quest to motivate you throughout your adventures.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >I don&rsquo;t really have much to complain about here but one thing to note is that this game is hard and the secret levels (more on that later) are even harder. The pinnacle trials of this game require precision, patience, and a mastery over the platforming mechanics in the game. While the game does provide a reasonable avenue to have enough lives to overcome these hurdles, some levels will absolutely tear through your reserves so consider this a warning; no strong negative, but certainly be prepared.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >These next points are subjective and both refer to the feel of the platforming itself. The DKC series has always been a bit slippery with regards to its surfaces and we&rsquo;re not talking about just icy levels. This is indeed by design though it isn't my favorite implementation; I generally prefer extremely snappy controls for precision platformers. On a similar note, Tropical Freeze takes a strong approach to momentum where DK feels heavy and carries high inertia. Once DK is moving it takes quite a bit of effort to get him to stop; the flip side is also true aside from the roll which becomes your main way of accelerating into your next jump. Mastering the roll is a key factor in whether the game feels tight and responsive versus unruly and sluggish &mdash; a welcome challenge that is extremely satisfying to conquer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >My final minor gripe is the limited variety and lack of replayability in bonus rooms. These hidden areas, accessed through hidden entrances scattered across each level, feature brief platforming challenges that reward you with a puzzle piece. You&rsquo;ll have to launch through barrels, jump on springs, or ride moving platforms to collect all of the bananas within the time limit.. Considering how frequently these rooms appear throughout the game, some variation in their design would help keep them fresh. Additionally, since you can't retry a bonus room after failing it, any mistake will require a full level restart if you're aiming for 100% completion &mdash; making the repetition even more apparent. Again, not a huge deal here and these rooms are fun enough to be a decent change of pace.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Music -->
            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The legendary David Wise, composer of the original </span><em><span >Donkey Kong Country</span></em><span >, is back with this masterpiece of a soundtrack. The music in Tropical Freeze is mostly atmospheric, bringing plenty of new tunes but also featuring a myriad of references to the older titles. Each song does a masterful job at emboldening the settings created by the environment. A wide variety of percussion and traditional instruments lay the foundation for simple yet emotional melodies that are incredibly effective at adding to the overall tone that the game sets. We&rsquo;ll get more into the callbacks to other games later, but just know that Tropical Freeze is a love letter to </span><em><span >Donkey Kong Country 2</span></em><span > and the series as a whole, so without any further introduction let&rsquo;s go through some of the amazing tracks that are new to this installment of the franchise.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Busted Bayou&rdquo; is the track for level 1-B which is the second secret level of World 1 and the first silhouette level in the game. These levels have some of the coolest artistic stylization, opting to only color the background environments while having the level itself as a silhouette only. This also goes for the characters, where you&rsquo;ll only see the dark silhouette of DK and his companions, aside from their telltale accessories: like the red of DK&rsquo;s tie, the pink of Dixie&rsquo;s bandana, or the grey of Cranky&rsquo;s beard.</span></p>
<p><span >Onto the music itself &mdash; this track is heavily inspired by reggae, yet blends the style seamlessly into the feel of the game. The relaxed nature of the track fits beautifully with the minimalist aesthetic of the level and is an absolute joy to listen to. It kicks off with a typical reggae drum break, a groovy electric guitar lead, and a rhythmic electric bass to lay the foundation. An additional electric guitar with slight distortion plays the signature reggae pattern on each offbeat. This syncopation, paired with the rhythmic layering across the instruments, gives the track the signature funky bounce that reggae is known for.</span></p>
<p><span >An acoustic guitar carries the melody until 0:39 where the pan flute enters with the main musical idea. At 0:59, the steel drums &mdash; originating from Trinidad and Tobago &mdash; introduce the second verse, accompanied by soft synth pads that enhance the tropical, laid-back vibe of the song. Another drum break leads us into the next section at 1:41, where funky synthesizers bring in an &rsquo;80s-style groove. The steel drums then return to support this phrase, while the acoustic guitar plays a continuation of its earlier pattern. At 2:18, the acoustic guitar takes the spotlight to play the main lick, joined by the pan flute, which chimes in with a cheery countermelody of its own. Everything builds toward 2:38, where an alto saxophone steps in with a beautiful solo. From there, we ease into a bridge led by the electric bass before looping back to the beginning. This lyrical game of musical chairs keeps the melodically chill tune upbeat and engaging, allowing your ear to follow the trail of shifting instruments and appreciate the unique texture that each one brings to the party.</span></p>
<p><span >Next up, we&rsquo;ve got three songs from World 2: &ldquo;Windmill Hill,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mountain Mania,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wing Ding.&rdquo; These pieces all share a central theme that&rsquo;s altered and remixed across each track, creating a strong sense of continuity and cohesion throughout this autumn-inspired world. The opening harmonica-like synth of &ldquo;Windmill Hill&rdquo; is a variation of the clarinet melody that appears at 0:17 in &ldquo;Wing Ding.&rdquo; Similarly, the call and response between the winds and the trombone at 2:01 in &ldquo;Wing Ding&rdquo; mirrors the main line of &ldquo;Mountain Mania&rdquo; at 1:51. Despite these connections, each track maintains its own distinct identity and feeling &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s an easygoing country flow, a rowdy Bavarian polka, or the laid-back DKC vibe with a funky bassline. Even so, they all feel intimately familiar with one another and provide a solid, thematic through line for the world as a whole.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another level in World 2 deserves some attention especially with how it manages to tie the soundtrack with the gameplay. We&rsquo;re talking about 2-3 which features &ldquo;Horn Top Hop&rdquo; and &ldquo;Horn Ascent&rdquo; as the songs you&rsquo;ll hear throughout the stage. The former starts out with a lovely piano, strumming guitar, and bongo rhythm; quickly you&rsquo;ll hear horns, saxophone, and clarinet enter with an old-timey folk rhythm. This ties neatly with the literal horns you&rsquo;ll find in the level: these massive saxophones will play a note in sync with the track to provide a gust of wind to aid in your traversal of the stage. The low brass plays a classic &ldquo;oompah&rdquo; bassline on the beat while the saxophone plays the melody and the clarinet supports with a harmony line. The second section of the song passes the melody between several softer instruments: harp, followed by the chimes, and then the acoustic guitar all take their recapitulation of the main idea. These variations provide excellent color to the track as a whole and provide interesting ideas for your ear to latch onto. The climax of the level occurs when DK rocket barrels into an enormous wind instrument taller than any tree. At this point you&rsquo;ll hear the ascent version of the track which mostly allows rhythm and percussion to fill the space, aside from a massive note to be played by many horns in harmony every four bars. On this beat exactly a sweeping current fills the entire instrument in-game and lifts Donkey Kong up and through the tubing. You&rsquo;ll have to dodge obstacles and cling to the walls in between notes to manage your climb. This is a brilliantly designed level that seamlessly merges the music with the challenge facing the player; an absolute treat.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Grassland Groove&rdquo; is such a celebration of a level as you&rsquo;ll swing and jump through a parade with Baobab trees from Madagascar in the background all while jamming to music inspired from the region of sub-Saharan Africa. The tune kicks off with various percussion instruments playing in polyrhythm &mdash; where different rhythmic patterns are played simultaneously. We also have a traditional choir singing the melody and supporting the track with chords and harmonies. At 0:56 we have the bridge where the polyrhythm craziness continues and a host of voices chant to the beat. 1:40 brings the next section where the pan flute and marimba play supporting rhythms while the choir returns in full unison. The lead vocals then join in before another quick vocal interlude. The next idea starts at 2:10 where a male choir this time joins an acoustic guitar for the melody while the rest of the choir continues to provide harmonies and the marimba maintains the rhythmic backbone of the piece. This piece overall exudes happiness and merriment, which, when combined with the imaginative set piece of a parade will just make you smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >You&rsquo;ll hear me gush more about World 5 in the spoiler section, but we can discuss &ldquo;Fruity Factory&rdquo; in isolation of that. This track stands out in Tropical Freeze a bit due to its use of synthetic sounds, especially the crunchy, distorted synth you&rsquo;ll hear at 0:26. This song is a marimba feature, starting out with a marimba ostinato that will persist throughout most of the track. Most of the music is ambient with the occasional melody getting passed around by a dual mallet marimba and a pan flute. At 0:53 the marimba takes the lead while the flute plays a soft countermelody to keep you listening. We enter a bridge at 1:25 fully led by the mechanical synth before going straight back into a beautifully accented flute passage which is supported by a countermelody in the marimba this time around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For a song titled &ldquo;Seashore War&rdquo; there isn&rsquo;t much aggression in this arrangement &mdash; rather, the title refers to DK&rsquo;s return to his home island which has now frozen over due to the invasion of the Snowmads. The track is beautifully melancholic to support this bittersweet return but maintains an ever present sense that there is hope and you must press on.</span></p>
<p><br /><span >Right off the bat we open with taiko drums (a traditional Japanese instrument), a rain stick, and sustained string harmonies that will drive the chord progression. We slowly add more percussion in with the plucked koto at 0:17 playing a moving figure in the background and 0:34 continues to build the layering with a harp and marimba. 0:49 is the soft yet grand entrance of the acoustic guitar supported by vocal harmonies from the choir, further emphasized by the strings and drums fading out. When you think of an acoustic guitar you&rsquo;ll likely imagine one that has metal strings, but in this case the wonderfully warm timbre is actually caused by nylon strings. The melody is so sparse and simple, yet incredibly emotional especially in tandem with the delicate choir vocals. We also hear a synth I can only describe as a whale sound at 1:00, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:28 that is just so lonely yet powerful as it bends through the chord progression. While this piece is slow moving, there is so much action packed into the instrumentation and the rhythm: listen deeply at 1:41 for just how many percussion lines (mallets and plucked instruments) are fluttering around at the same time; it really brings the whole piece together by providing more texture for us to pay attention to. We continue the escalation at 2:16 when the male vocals join the choir, evocative of the singing in the famous piece &ldquo;Baba Yetu&rdquo; from </span><em><span >Civilization IV</span></em><span >. All of this build swells into 2:34 which doesn&rsquo;t strike you with a huge movement, but leads into the harmonica entrance for a isolated and mournful solo that will take us into the bridge to round out the track. Beautiful, just give it a listen with your eyes closed and some nice headphones.</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >Before we get into the songs that reference previous games in the series, let&rsquo;s talk about the boss themes because they are incredible. Each world ends with a boss fight against a different member of the Snowmad Tribe who each have an awesome metal theme filled with rocking electric guitars.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The World 1 boss is Pompy, The Presumptuous, a sea lion who fights you by sliding up and down an enormous ice half pipe; nothing more to say here. &ldquo;Big Top Bop&rdquo; is the backing track to this encounter and starts out with a classic metal gallop and some distorted synths. 0:22 is where we diverge from the typical genre though as a keyboard doubles the electric guitar before the lead guitar takes the solo. &ldquo;Punch Bowl&rdquo; is the theme for the World 5 boss: Bashmaster, The Unbreakable, a polar bear with a gigantic hammer that is ready to bash. We open up with some heavily distorted electric guitars and a crunchy synth at 0:09 to double the guitar. Our lead guitar takes the melody at 0:32 before another synth builds at 0:48 with an electric guitar wailing behind it in a counter melody. These tracks are both high energy, epic backdrops that are perfect accents to the finale of each world; the departure from the typically environmental soundtrack makes them stand out even more gloriously.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay as promised, it&rsquo;s time to discuss a few of the many references to other Donkey Kong Country games found throughout the soundtrack. Here we go!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >We&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;Secret Temple 1&rdquo; which plays during some of the K levels in each world &mdash; this a full remake of &ldquo;DK Island Swing&rdquo; which is the original theme for the jungle world in </span><em><span >Donkey Kong Country</span></em><span >. The main changes here are instrumentation, where we get to hear proper instruments instead of the MIDI sounds from the old days. 0:32 starts a gradual crescendo with the iconic bassline while the brass build up to the main theme.&nbsp; Some new additions at 0:36 like the trumpet fanfare and trombone harmonies keep things fresh and interesting until 0:44 where the iconic trumpet flare ends this epic buildup as we blast into the two decade old melody in the trumpet section with trombones on the countermelody. 0:55 introduces some new synthesizer pads as well as a baritone saxophone joining the clarinet for the countermelody. The alto saxophone then gets its time in the sun when it has a solo on the main line at 1:07. If this song doesn&rsquo;t make you want to get up and move I don&rsquo;t know what will.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Current Capers&rdquo; instantly starts out with one of the most recognizable ostinato patterns in video games &mdash;&nbsp; the soft, watery synth of &ldquo;Aquatic Ambience&rdquo; is a classic motif that even managed to leave people with fond memories of a water level. 0:52 brings back the same synth sound that you&rsquo;ll recognize from the original, accompanied by piano embellishments and a light synth bassline. At 1:22 a lovely harp run leads us straight into the main melody as a harmonica-like synth plays our full reprise of the original theme with the same beautiful, longing tone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The song &ldquo;Frosty Fruits&rdquo; blends a familiar motif with a more industrial soundscape enforced by cold-sounding percussion, such as metal mallets on the vibraphone and xylophone. This evokes the frosty atmosphere while warbling synths and a distorted, muffled bassline groove &mdash; complete with pitch slides &mdash; represent the mechanical quality of the level. It is this fusion of atmospheric sounds and factory-like elements that denotes the musical image of World 5. Ambient wind sounds, wispy choir pads, and a&nbsp; sweeping synth heighten the ethereal quality, and at 1:20, the glockenspiel quietly reintroduces the melody from &ldquo;In a Snow-Bound Land,&rdquo; lending the track a nostalgic and dreamy feel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I already mentioned that the Tropical Freeze soundtrack is a love letter to DKC 2, so let&rsquo;s dive into a bunch of the musical callbacks that you&rsquo;ll hear while exploring this game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Homecoming Hijinx&rdquo; is a phenomenal way to kick off the introduction to the familiar looking World 6 (more on that later) by using the leitmotif of the Kremlins &mdash;&nbsp; villainous crocodiles that you encounter in earlier DKC games &mdash; that you first hear when you approach their domain in DKC 2. At 0:30 the glockenspiel plays a variation of the introduction to &ldquo;Welcome to Crocodile Isle&rdquo; before fully swelling into the motif at 1:03 with a beautiful cello feature. This slowed down and rearranged version of the leitmotif turns the initial ferocity of the theme into one that is more somber and appropriate for the bittersweet return to DK&rsquo;s home island.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The next track &ldquo;Amiss Abyss&rdquo; is a beautiful composition on its own for us to analyze, but it also hides two motifs from DKC 2 that we&rsquo;ll cover. After some spacey synths and muted percussion intro the song, 0:09 introduces a lead piano with a lovely solo idea. This gets compounded with some string stabs poking around until 0:25 when a cheery flute bounds in and carries the melody before handing it back to the piano. 0:45 marks the first reference and it's quite subtle: a really faint synth in the background plays the syncopated rhythm from the synth buildup in &ldquo;Stickerbrush Symphony&rdquo;. We then go straight into the next section at 1:01 as the melodica moves us forwards with a marimba pattern for support. The second reference then comes in at 1:17 with the harp playing an altered version of the opening ostinato from &ldquo;Aquatic Ambience&rdquo;. The airy melody in the pan flute-sounding synth and the strings is sparse enough to let this nostalgic pattern take up just enough space to catch our attention while simultaneously blending into the track. This piece is a wonderful collaboration of old and new sounds, bundled into a serene yet groovy song that continues the tradition of creating water levels that are remembered for their musical beauty.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Scorch &lsquo;N&rsquo; Torch&rdquo; is another excellent track that has undertones of tragic loneliness, yet filled with enough hope to keep you moving. Traditional percussion and a distorted synth set the rhythm before a reverb synth plays the main line into massive drum beats at 0:14. This intro leads into 0:25 where we find the primary driver of this piece: the violin section playing a sixteenth note ostinato figure. Our buildup starts at 0:58 with deep synth bass harmonies and a vocalization from the pan flute. It all culminates at 1:07 with the pan flute passionately delivering a variation on the main melody from &ldquo;Stickerbrush Symphony&rdquo; with the strings still dramatically driving us forward. This is a masterclass in how to incorporate old works into a modern arrangement: evoking nostalgic emotions while letting new passages tell most of the story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I hope you&rsquo;re not tired of &ldquo;Stickerbrush Symphony&rdquo; yet since we&rsquo;ve got two more tracks that are a full reprise of this song. Both &ldquo;Savannah Symphony&rdquo; and &ldquo;Staff Roll Part 2&rdquo; have a full reimagining of this classic tune in their own ways. The former takes the World 3 representative instrumentation of the pan flute and choir and mixes it with the familiar synths of the original. The latter opens with a funky alto saxophone line before making space for the emotional melody of the original. After both pieces have had their turn, this section of the credits rolls allows the two to blend by overlaying the original melody on piano with an improv sax solo. To me this reads as a fully realized, musical celebration of the franchise and how far it&rsquo;s come, twenty years later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Last but not least we&rsquo;ve got one more theme that makes its reappearance: all rocket barrels levels have their own remix of &ldquo;Rocket Barrel 1&rdquo; from </span><em><span >Donkey Kong Country Returns</span></em><span >. Whether the murine mischievousness of &ldquo;Rodent Ruckus&rdquo;, serpent infested waters of &ldquo;Twilight Terror&rdquo;, mechanical monstrosity in &ldquo;Reckless Ride&rdquo;, or crystalline chaos of &ldquo;Blurry Flurry&rdquo;, this theme brings an amazing energy that matches the frantic nature of these levels. Musically, the opening sixteen bars are quite interesting as the first and second halves alternate between 5/4 and 4/4. This phrase repeats once until it leads into the remainder of the tune which stays in 4/4. The time signature transitions are incredibly smooth, so much so that you may not even notice them. Their effect, though, is palpable as the track sounds filled to the brim with enough tension to explode like a rocket barrel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Let&rsquo;s zoom into &ldquo;Blurry Flurry&rdquo; for a deeper look at what&rsquo;s going on in this piece. The string section plays a hectic pattern underneath a punchy brass opener that lets you know it means business. The 4/4 section has the low brass play a descending quarter note figure to march us forward while a trumpet solo leads the charge. We soften a bit at 0:32 with a flute countermelody which foreshadows the pace change at 0:41 where the panic subsides. At this point the flute retains the lead with a jazzy line while low brass and strings keep the bassline rolling. 0:45 brings in a muted trombone to carry the melody, doubled by a glockenspiel (for extra snowiness) before handing things off to the full string section for emphasis. The trumpet and brass take back the reins at 1:03 for two loops, the second of which adds in a choir for supporting vocal harmonies. We hit a key change at 1:21 as we rise from B flat minor to C minor as the choir intensifies. Almost all instruments then drop away as the clarinet then takes the melody supported only by the string section and drums, before ramping back into the full powered brass at 1:40. After this we complete the loop and head back to the beginning of the track, what a ride!&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There&rsquo;s also a small moment in this Blurry Flurry that is an awesome cameo from DKCR: the &ldquo;Big Squeekly&rdquo; (a massive bat) which chased you in stage 4-5 of that game can be seen in the background. It&rsquo;s now completely frozen in ice as you soar past it during this level which is an amazing attention to detail.</span></p>

                    <p><span >When it comes to inspired level design, you don&rsquo;t have to look any further than World 5 in Tropical Freeze &mdash; Juicy Jungle. This world is a masterclass in thematic cohesion, taking you through the entire process of making fruity popsicles. As you move from level to level you&rsquo;ll see the whole process happen around you: fruit is harvested, chopped, juiced, frozen, and served in popsicle form. In 5-1, you&rsquo;re dodging falling fruit as it&rsquo;s being collected. By 5-3, you&rsquo;re rolling past slicing machines as conveyor belts carry the fruit along. In 5-4, you&rsquo;re swimming through juice vats while the fruit gets grated and squeezed.Come 5-5, the juice has set into jello cubes that become springy platforms for you to leap from. And finally, in 5-6, you find yourself in a freezer, parkouring across the freshly shaped popsicles that cap off the whole delicious process. It might sound simple, but the environmental storytelling here is immaculate. The attention to detail turns a joyful concept into something memorable and contributes to the charm of this game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another attention to detail that I personally enjoy is that each level in World 6 is a callback to the different worlds in </span><em><span >Donkey Kong Country Returns</span></em><span >. Level 6-1, Homecoming Hijinx, takes you through the Jungle world where DK&rsquo;s house has frozen over. From the beach to the factory and all up the volcano, reliving the entire prequel adventure in this last world provides an excellent sense of finality to the game and really emphasizes the &ldquo;coming home&rdquo; aspect that the game aims to achieve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Moving on to some of the secrets that you&rsquo;ll find throughout the levels in the game, ranging from the collectibles we spoke about earlier to entirely new levels that you may not have seen. Every world has two additional levels (labeled N-A and N-B) that are only accessible if you exit another level through a secret portal. These hidden exits are off the beaten path and usually require the aid of an assist character to access. Some worlds have only one exit that leads two both extra levels while others hide the exit in the &lsquo;A&rsquo; level itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There is an additional level to be found in each world: the &lsquo;K&rsquo; level (dubbed N-K). If you successfully gather all of the KONG letters for every level in a world, you&rsquo;ll unlock the &lsquo;K&rsquo; level for that world. As a warning, these levels are a proper challenge. These difficult levels will test your platforming and mastery of different obstacles featured throughout the game &mdash; all without any checkpoints. Why go through this then? Well first of all they have puzzle pieces to collect, but second and more interestingly completion of each K level will grant you a relic. If you collect seven relics &mdash; one from each of the six worlds and an additional one from the final boss &mdash; you&rsquo;ll unlock the hidden 7th world of Tropical Freeze, Secret Seclusion. The seventh world contains only three levels but they certainly make up for it with some brutally difficult platforming. These final levels force you to bring everything you&rsquo;ve learned to the table and execute it nearly flawlessly; no checkpoints and a nontrivial length render these levels as some of the hardest in the game. That being said, the satisfaction from completing all of these gauntlet style levels is exceptional and gives hardcore platforming fans a tough yet achievable goal to strive for. Oh, and these three levels also have puzzle pieces in them that are deviously placed so bring your absolute best if you want to walk the 100% completion red carpet. Completing all three will also enable the capsule machine to deploy the final figurine, Professor Chops. So reliable, so knowledgeable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >What awaits the intrepid collector for their dedication and effort is an array of beautiful concept art. From black and white sketches to full blown environment illustrations, these provide a great motivation to dredge up every last puzzle piece that the game has to offer. The final few images are locked behind hard mode which will require you to beat the game again but with only one heart instead of two. Honestly I&rsquo;d prefer for that not to be the case, as exploring the depths of each level for every puzzle piece in my eyes meets the bar of completion and is worthy of the full reward. Hard mode itself is not for the faint of heart and is an extreme test only for the most devoted players. Hard mode isn&rsquo;t my personal choice for this game, the puzzle piece gauntlet provides a great sense of finality for me and is a fitting way to reach 100% completion.</span></p>
