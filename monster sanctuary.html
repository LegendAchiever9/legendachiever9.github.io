                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Enjoy the strategy and teambuilding of a turn-based monster battler while navigating the interconnected world of a metroidvania. Assemble a team of unique monsters to traverse an expansive world as you battle to ascend the ranks of the Keeper&rsquo;s Guild. Monster Sanctuary takes the creature collector genre and focuses heavily on nuanced teambuilding, where a deep skill tree for every individual monster gives you the ability to customize your party into the perfect turn-based battle machine.</span></p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section for Content -->
            <section id="content">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >I&rsquo;ll start by reinforcing that the heart of this game is in the teambuilding aspect. The core loop is not too dissimilar to classic creature collector games like </span><em><span >Pokemon</span></em><span > where you&rsquo;ll encounter a wide variety of monsters and eventually assemble a team to engage in turn-based combat.&nbsp; The difference lies in the approach towards these central mechanics &mdash; instead of catching monsters you&rsquo;ll earn eggs at the end of combat in order to hatch them on your own, combat takes the form of a 3v3 battle driven by a combo system, and exploring the terrain is gated by the movement abilities of your team. The combat itself is quite in depth where every triggered action increases your combo meter; in turn, the damage of each monster&rsquo;s attack is multiplied by your current combo: so the name of the game is using two of your three party members to provide support and build combo, while the third prepares for a massive attack. Your performance in battle is also rated on a six star scale depending on your use of elemental effectiveness, maximum combo, number of turns spent, and more. Your battle rating determines the value of the rewards you earn post combat, no small component of which are eggs used to hatch your own monsters. A perfect six star rating will earn you rare drops that will help you strengthen your team without having to farm too much for materials, so you&rsquo;ll definitely want to use different teams depending on the situation to maximize your score.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The way to construct a team to achieve these high ratings for the various battles throughout the game though is where most of the strategy comes in, as there are so many ways to customize your setup. Every monster has a massive skill tree that allows you to tailor it according to your preferred style, so your cute blob slime from the first area can either be a combo setter focused on healing and buffs or a debuff spreading menace that shreds the armor of your opponents. Not only that, each monster has four item slots: one primary weapon and three additional accessories. With 100+ pieces of equipment in the game, there will be no shortage of options for you to experiment with. Additionally, all equipment can be upgraded up to five times by using crafting materials found by exploring the world or through combat. Another minor component that alters your team is three food slots where you can apply stat buffs to each of your monsters &mdash; load up your tanky monsters with bananas to boost health or raspberries to increase critical strike damage. There is one more mechanic that significantly boosts the power and nature of each monster in your party and it&rsquo;s a great system to engage with, but it&rsquo;s a bit of a surprise in the story so I&rsquo;ll cover it in the spoiler section later on. I guess you&rsquo;ll have to keep reading or play the game yourself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another common concept present in this genre is evolution and while it is present in Monster Sanctuary it takes a bit of a backseat and is not directly tied to increasing a monster&rsquo;s power. If you&rsquo;re familiar with the Scyther evolution line in </span><em><span >Pokemon</span></em><span > you&rsquo;ll know where this is going, but effectively evolving a monster in this game does not make it stronger or weaker, rather it changes where the strengths of the monster are focused. While a caterpillar might focus on shields and buffs, its evolved moth form may focus more on attacks. Given this lateral setup, evolution is not super common within the game and since most monster eggs can be found through a playthrough, the system mostly serves as a way to access some harder to reach monsters. That being said, the guessing game of finding an evolution item and wondering which monster it applies to was pretty enjoyable and entertained the collector&rsquo;s mindset that metroidvanias are known for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Speaking of which, even with the depth of the combat system this game is indeed a metroidvania so let&rsquo;s cover some of those elements. As always, you&rsquo;ll frequently find sections of the environment that are impassable given your current moveset. Monster Sanctuary spices things up a bit by only having a select few upgrades for your character, but focuses the majority of the exploration mechanics towards different monsters. A high ledge is no match for a dragon while a wide spanning sea is a simple task for a pufferfish. Crawling vines yield to sharp claws or fireballs while shimmering diamonds hold little resistance to a stampeding dinosaur. The world is quite interconnected and while there are plenty of puzzles and secrets that will require clever use of your team&rsquo;s abilities, the exploration is mostly a function to acquire items and upgrade materials to enhance your team. I&rsquo;ll cover this a bit more in depth in the pain points section, but the system works well to set the stage for the rest of the game&rsquo;s strengths.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >One of the more hidden aspects of this game that is absolutely amazing is the level of convenience that has been added. This is actually a strong differentiator from </span><em><span >Pokemon</span></em><span > &mdash; generally the mainline games struggle with incorporating quality of life features which is a major reason why they&rsquo;re a deep focus for rom hacks in the emulation space. Monster Sanctuary learned this lesson early and is filled with small features that make your time as a player feel much more respected. Fast travel points around the map, mounts to accelerate your traversal, and items to warp you back to the hub make backtracking much less of a hassle. Items to raise old monsters to your level cap, items to respec your monsters&rsquo; skills, and the egg hatching system yielding monsters that are slightly under your level cap are all excellent changes that remove tedium and allow you to focus on what you actually care about without compromising how you play.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The story isn&rsquo;t anything crazy but fulfills its function well as a way to add some stakes to each battle. While wild battles are the standard 3v3, battles against NPCs have each participant bring a team of six. Additionally, there are champion monsters that serve as boss battles where your team of three will contend with a single, powered up monster. These are generally heightened versions of other monsters you can find throughout the world, but some &ldquo;super&rdquo; champion monsters act as optional endgame bosses and can only be acquired by defeating them with a five star rating. Champion monsters have an enormous mana pool and can take multiple actions per turn, so you&rsquo;ll need a solid strategy and strong team to emerge victorious from these battles.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The art style is quite simple but effective in conveying all the information you need while holding an old school charm. Most of the game uses sprite-based pixel art, but the style of the in-game monster journal depictions are a great way to showcase their vibrant design and personalities.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >With so many choices and levers to pull for optimizing every monster, it can certainly be hard to gauge what the best options are. Min-maxers will definitely be at home in this game, especially since so much of the strategy and skill takes place in team building before the fight even begins. While it can be daunting, this system is what provides depth and makes the game more interesting. So I wouldn&rsquo;t call this a pure downside, just know that in order to get the most of your team you'll need to do quite a bit of reading or experimenting to plan out a well-synergized team.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another point revolves around pacing throughout the game. The first battles will feel slow and your team&rsquo;s power level will be lacking due to low levels and a smaller pool of monsters to choose from. However, as the game begins to open up and you find your footing, you&rsquo;ll be off to the races. That is, until you reach the later stages of the game where you&rsquo;ve more or less locked in your main team. You&rsquo;ll likely have a set rotation of moves to execute for standard battles which can certainly feel repetitive at times. That being said, the harder fights in the game as well as optional content certainly challenge and incentivize you to explore different team options and even employ a rotating roster depending on what kind of challenge&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >awaits you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >A smaller issue for me is the incentive to have multiple copies of the same monster on your team to maximize synergies. There isn&rsquo;t anything wrong with this inherently, I just value a diverse team using different abilities over a highly optimized team using two of the same monster.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I alluded to the last pain point earlier and it stems from the fact that the metroidvania part of the game is secondary to the teambuilding and combat. While not bad by any means, you&rsquo;ll rarely get a highlight moment from exploring. That being said, finding a monster with a new exploration ability for the overworld is still enjoyable and going through the interconnected world for the first time is still quite effective.</span></p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section for Music -->
            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The soundtrack in Monster Sanctuary does a great job at building the instrumentation throughout each piece to make it interesting to listen to even through many loops. This is the hallmark of a well written area theme for video games and each song creatively builds on its theme while staying consistent with the region. As you listen, pay special attention to how each new phrase adds new lines and switches instrumentation to keep your ear interested in what comes next. The loop for each track is usually not more than two minutes so each piece is quite dynamic before repeating back to the beginning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The soundtrack for this game includes original and demo versions of several themes and while for the most part I think the newer versions fit the game better, I really like &ldquo;Snowy Peaks (Original)&rdquo; so we&rsquo;ll talk about that in comparison to &ldquo;Snowy Peaks&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The standard version that you hear in-game opens with a piano ostinato and features a beautiful oboe melody with a full string section supporting the chords underneath. There is a great sense of weightlessness and grace to this, which is heightened to a feeling of grandeur when a whistling synth takes over the lead and the brass section plays the harmonies. The moving low string line also adds more propulsion to the song to keep momentum. It sounds great and still gives the correct vibe for a snowy mountain, but I think the original does a few things differently that enhance the listening experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The original also starts out with a piano ostinato but also has a ticking sound to keep things moving; perhaps this version felt a bit too fast and they were going for a more relaxed sound. That being said, when the pizzicato string pattern joins in and the flute melody starts, I find the tone to still be quite serene. The low string patterns are still here and soon we add a piano countermelody to the flute which provides more movement without feeling too muddy. The cello entrance at 0:41 is beautiful and paired with the glockenspiel takes us to four different moving lines which to me matches the natural beauty of snow while still respecting the lack of order that comes with it. The non-rhythm section instruments drop out at 1:02 for a lovely violin solo &mdash; though after the first passage we add the piano as a countermelody to bolster the main line. I really enjoy the timbre of this piece and the focus on isolated solo instruments above the percussive mix lends itself really well to being atop the snowy peaks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;PvP Battle&rdquo; serves as the battle theme for when you duel another Keeper or take part in the PvP arena and starts out in 3/4 with a high action piano line on top of some light rhythm and a repeated sonar-like synth. At 0:11 we add in a punchy bass, a lead string synth, and some string pads which are soon doubled by vocals. The intro rounds out at 0:21 with some accented stabs (marcato) before taking us into the main groove which is actually in 4/4 now: a synth takes the main melody while we get a funky bassline playing underneath some piano chords. The next phrase at 0:38 has the string section and glockenspiel double the main line before we get a small section akin to a dance break with just bass and the leading synths. After this we reach the bridge at 1:01 which is in 6/8 to give a more lax feeling of two &mdash; vocal pads and a sweeping wind synth takes the melody while another synth sings the countermelody. The last section is back in 4/4 where the piano and synth take the main line while we hear the same countermelody from the bridge. Lots of moving parts that build on each other here to keep the track interesting and upbeat, perfect for a battle.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Now for a less upbeat combat theme we have &ldquo;Alchemist Battle&rdquo; which starts out with some dissonant, foreboding chords. These fade out for a full rock drumset and fast moving electric bassline. A low, organ-like synth and a high, bell-sounding synth play the main line here over the rhythm section while a faint screaming sound rises in intensity behind the instrumentation. The higher synth swaps out for a lower one playing the harmonies before we reach 0:31 which presents a new lyrical idea. At 0:43 this changes into a repeated phrase which then gets doubled by the full mix to build tension. We drop back down immediately with some rich, synth pads to augment this second time around the melody. At 1:18 we fade down the whole mix to a fast moving eighth note phrase in the synth before a bass lick takes us into the pre-bridge. All of the instruments play in unison here for an accented version of the repeated phrase from earlier which brings us into 1:44 where we break down into the bridge. A new, brighter synth takes over the melody while the piano plays some chords and a countermelody before we loop back to the beginning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Next up is a more peaceful track &ldquo;Sun Palace&rdquo; that plays in the area of the same name &mdash; a lone harp plays while a cello holds a sustained note to support. We then kick into the groove with a drum pattern as the brass section plays some soft pads and the piano plays low tones with the sustain pedal. A high reverb synth follows in the next phrase until 0:32 where a high string synth floats above the beat with an echoing pattern. At 0:37 a high whistling synth takes the lead while the piano plays a counter melody underneath. Our final layer of the track is the lovely oboe melody at 0:47 with a syncopated ostinato pattern in the lower harp register. We can also hear a faint gong sound at the start of the phrase along with some deeper bass notes and a falling chime synth pattern at the end of each two bar phrase.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Mystical Workshop&rdquo; opens up with a slightly foreboding piano intro with the right hand playing the melody and the left hand playing an alternating pattern. Under this we have a full string section playing sustained note harmonies which culminate at 0:17 with an unresolved chord that leads us in the groove of this piece: a simple drum beat accompanied by the low strings playing a menacing ostinato which matches the factory nature of this area. A vocal synth plays the harmony with some piano accents until 0:38 where a high, whistle synth takes the melody and we pass the repeated pattern to the electric bass. We can also hear a xylophone playing falling sixteenth notes in the background in addition to a breakdown of the bassline every fourth bar. At 0:57 the song takes a hopeful turn where the melody and bass line ascend backed by a pizzicato counter melody in the strings before a high synth doubles the main line for a unison finish before looping back to the beginning.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Underworld&rdquo; is an insane, ominous mix of liquid drum and bass taking turns with a swaying funeral dirge. We start out with a deep, sustained piano note which is doubled by the low strings while a rapid hi-hat figure creates the &ldquo;ticking&rdquo; sound to propel the track forward. Echoing high notes in the piano take the place of our main line while a high pitched synth plays the harmony and another drum adds to the fast moving percussion line. At 0:28 we have a tonal shift where the feel of the music switches into two &mdash; our underlying percussion line stays the same while the piano, synths, and strings all play in unison while a choir sings the supporting harmonies. At 0:47 we add a tension-building piano rhythm into the mix before continuing the rise in intensity. This all falls into 1:24 for the calming bridge with just piano and string bass on top of the rhythm section. A piano lick takes us into 1:43 for the final repetition where most of the instrumentation plays together in harmony.</span></p>

                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >When you find an important tree in the base game and then you find another, seemingly more important tree in the DLC, it&rsquo;s reasonable to think that they&rsquo;re somehow connected. This is certainly true for &ldquo;Tree of Evolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;World Tree&rdquo; as the former is simply an offshoot of the primordial world tree that we discover in the forgotten world at the deepest depths of the sanctum.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Tree of Evolution&rdquo; features an oboe melody on top of a harp ostinato with interjections from vocal synths and the piano. A place of serenity from the harp and melody and a place of gravitas from the rumbling low strings and responses from the synths and piano. &ldquo;World Tree&rdquo; puts a spin on the former theme with a few adjustments: it plays at a much higher tempo, the harp ostinato has a different melody and switches to piano, and the opening plays a variation of the oboe solo heard before. Where the song really starts to diverge is at 0:30 where we break into a groove with a fast piano ostinato, funky bassline, brass harmonies, and a trumpet melody. This lead is soon doubled by a synth and the string section before looping again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >People are always saying how tunes from a bard just need a good bass and kick &mdash; fortunately, &ldquo;Bard&rsquo;s Lullaby&rdquo; does exactly that by taking an acoustic guitar melody and turning it into a peacefully hypnotic groove fitting for the lush environments of the forgotten world. The piece starts out with an acoustic guitar playing a bassline with a synth and piano playing supporting chords. The guitar lead then joins in with the main line until 0:19 where we add in an electric bass, synth bass, and drumset. This beat drives the whole song while the guitar and vocal synths continue until eventually being doubled by the piano. Given that a bard is meant to use music to influence others, finding such a comfortable pocket in this track is a great way to express the power of this monster who helps you restore balance to the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Both &ldquo;Legendary Keeper Battle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Forgotten Champion Battle&rdquo; are the themes for the hardest post-game content found in Monster Sanctuary, yet have different approaches in how they communicate that idea.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The myriad of statues depicting previous keepers found in the secret room of Magma Chamber all have their own challenge for your team &mdash; and those teams were all created by different backers of the game during funding, pretty neat. This track evolves from the previously discussed &ldquo;PvP Battle&rdquo; by taking a variation on the opening line, though this time backed by a much fuller instrumentation and rising melody to up the stakes. The piano takes over the bass line from the original while an electric bass plays a new pattern adorned with some fun licks at the end of each phrase. 0:59 uses a more intense whistle synth for the lead while trumpet stabs keep the intensity building.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Forgotten Champion Battle&rdquo; is only played during your battle against the Wanderer, Dracomer, and Terradrile who serve as the final bosses of the DLC. The piece starts with an accented string buildup for four bars before the brass section and percussion join in to amp up the tension. This tension holds for the next section as dark, repeated patterns and the droning bass push the piece. At 0:28 we start building again with a trumpet melody &mdash; we continue to hold the tension in the bridge as a synth plays an ascending line while a faint piano ostinato plays in the background and the bass continues to drive. At 1:01 we bring back the trumpet line with the original accented buildup from the start of the piece before the phrase finally resolves at the top of the octave. We get a new fanfare at 1:26 which works to change up the rhythm before preparing the track for another loop.</span></p>
                </section>

                <!-- Section for Spoiler Content -->
                <section id="content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >One last minor issue to mention before we move on, I wasn&rsquo;t a huge fan of exclusive overworld abilities. To the game&rsquo;s credit, there aren&rsquo;t many, but having both Levitate and Lofty Mount both be tied to super champion monsters only at the end of the game isn&rsquo;t ideal. Levitate especially blocks off a decent amount of content and while it was relieving to finally find this ability, I would have preferred to discover it more organically as opposed to by process of elimination.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >A quick counter to my earlier point about exploration, the drop into the forgotten world DLC was awesome and yielded the exact eureka moment that I&rsquo;ve grown to expect from metroidvanias or games with sprawling, yet interconnected worlds.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay the wait is over, let&rsquo;s talk about the last major mechanic that pushes the depth of customization even further when it comes to building a team: shifting. Every monster not only has their base form that you see in the wild, but starting after the events of the Sun Palace, they can also now have a dark or light shift. This conversion can also be applied by the player with an item, and it focuses the identity of the monster to a certain archetype while also massively boosting their stats. Take Monk for example: light shifting amplifies its supportive capabilities by spreading buffs throughout the party while dark shifting emphasizes damage dealing by ramping up critical strike chance and damage. This system is a really fun and engaging way to add more thoughtfulness to building out your team, as well as providing an avenue for any monster to fit the needs of your party.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As I mentioned earlier, you&rsquo;ll need to 5 star a champion monster fight if you want to earn their egg as a reward. So if you&rsquo;re trying to &ldquo;hatch &lsquo;em all&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll need to develop teams that can handle each of these fights in a quick enough manner to earn that grade. While the keeper battles throughout the story serve as a clear check as to what power level you should be at, these fights take it one step further &mdash; especially super champion monsters. While there are certainly some all rounder teams that are at such a high power level that they can conquer any champion battle in one or two turns, you&rsquo;ll need to do some experimenting with different teams and setups to find what works for you in each situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Speaking of tailoring a team for a specific challenge, there are two endgame sections that will certainly put your all star squad to the test: the infinity arena and the DLC-added legendary keeper battles. The Infinity Arena is as you may have guessed, an infinite gauntlet where you&rsquo;ll fight against a random wild monster encounter. The catch is that the levels of these monsters will continuously increase as you win, until the point where it is effectively impossible to progress. How far your team is able to push this endeavor is a solid measurement of strength while also being a stellar spot to farm for extra equipment and items. The legendary keeper grove in magma cavern is a different flavor of challenge, pitting your team against kickstarter backer teams of six. These are no walk in the park and have quite the range of strategies at hand, so you&rsquo;ll likely need to adapt your team or have a second roster to tackle configurations that may counter your standard composition.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Lastly, we have probably my favorite feature set that is included in Monster Sanctuary which takes a note from the success of rom hacks. After completing the game for the first time, you&rsquo;ll unlock randomizer mode and bravery mode. Randomizer mode is self explanatory, it will replace all monster spawns in each area with another; great for switching things up. Where it really begins to shine though, is when combined with the latter modifier, bravery mode &mdash; a mutation that prevents monster eggs from dropping. In their stead, a chest will be placed at the start of each area containing a single monster egg from that area&rsquo;s monster pool. The resulting gameplay pattern has a limited roster of monsters that forces you to create the best possible team with what is available. I found playing in this way to be extremely replayable and a phenomenal way to engage with the core systems of the game in a novel way. My run gave me an early Akhlut so I went with a chill team for the early game. As I progressed further, I started to come across more monsters with bleed support, eventually turning into a powerhouse bleed setup. I had a second team that centered around multi burn which was further amplified when I found Polterofen in the late game to add charge synergy to the mix. The finite resource limitation requires creativity and tests your ability to create a cohesive team while also making the discovery of each new area exciting due to seeing what monster you&rsquo;ll find next.</span></p>
