                <p><span >Have you ever played chess? What about the Eleventh Edition of Advanced Troll Chess? Square off against the Troll King in order to earn your right to cross the bridge. To where? It doesn&rsquo;t matter. Enter a battle of wits and honor where the only thing looser than the definition of chess is the rules.</span></p>

                <p><span >You&rsquo;re a lone soul that needs to cross a bridge, as that is your purpose. All that stands in your way is a troll who presents a simple arrangement: emerge victorious in a standard game of the Eleventh Edition of Advanced Troll Chess and they will let you pass. While you may be playing with chess pieces on a chess board, all of the rules are different. This isn&rsquo;t so bad you may think, until the catch reveals itself: the rules are redacted from the rulebook. Oh and one more thing, if a player cheats &mdash; knowingly or not &mdash; the other player may legally cheat however they like.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >King of the Bridge does an amazing job at gradually allowing you to discover the rules by capitalizing on your understanding of the rules of regular human chess. Make a move than would ordinarily be legal, and suddenly you&rsquo;re accused of cheating and then your king is forcibly removed from play; game over. The wonder of this game comes with learning what borders define the sandbox you find yourself in and how you tow the line between making new discoveries and not betraying old ones.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >There isn&rsquo;t much more I can say before the spoiler section aside from telling you that there is more than meets the eye with King of the Bridge, and it&rsquo;s an absolute delight to uncover the secrets it has to offer even throughout a short playtime.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >I really don&rsquo;t have anything here aside from the fact that the game is pretty short. I had such a good time that I found myself wanting more and of course I wish there was music, but for a solo dev project I certainly won&rsquo;t complain. The art is programmer art which has charm in its imprecision and in the face of a novel and enjoyable experience this wasn&rsquo;t a negative for me at all.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >This game has no OST, only environmental sounds and a jingle whenever you enforce the rules. There technically is a theme for the game&rsquo;s trailer, so I&rsquo;ll talk about that. The song consists of only violin, viola, and the cello which takes the main melody. A bouncy but sparsely played lead gives a feeling of mischievousness, like a child playing hide and seek but they keep telling you to close your eyes. The violins play a supporting line to keep the piece moving, while the viola occasionally doubles the violin or plays a brief countermelody. At 0:46 all of the strings play in unison for an emphatic and exciting end to the trailer which was certainly enough to hook my interest. Accuse me if you want, but this is my song of the game.</span></p>

                <p><b>This is the point of no return, where we'll discuss parts of the game that are SPOILERS. <br> Turn back now if you're not ready!</b></p>

                <!-- Section for Spoiler Content -->
                <section id="content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >The main focus as you start the game will be to discover all of the rules; some of my personal favorites are: &ldquo;pawns move like this because they are small minded&rdquo;, &ldquo;crown guy can move as he pleases. but he is also lazy&rdquo;, and &ldquo;only HE can jump&rdquo;. The simplicity and ridiculousness of the rules are so endearing that discovering them all will keep you playing even after you&rsquo;ve achieved one of the possible endings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Speaking of endings, there are four endings present in the game: the first is the bad ending, where you simply win a game while &ldquo;revenge&rdquo; cheating at least once. This is a core mechanic of the game where you can counter-cheat when the troll plays an illegal move. It is only natural for you to use this to your advantage, but the bad ending will have you turn into the troll as the cycle continues. The good ending on the other hand occurs when you are able to win without cheating in any form. This results in you being able to cross the bridge and reinforcing the method that cheating is not worth it, honor is everything.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >That gets the standard endings out of the way, leaving only the alternate options that will require you to push your curiosity. The first is the ultimate ascension ending, which you may try to achieve after reading the rule that pawns &ldquo;ascend&rdquo; instead of promoting when they reach the final row of the board. If this signaled to you that you should try ascending all of your pawns, then you&rsquo;d be correct! Doing this will invoke a &ldquo;pawnocalypse&rdquo;, summoning an infinite army of holy pawns to smite the troll. This was a crazy ending and the drama of it all was a defining moment of the small joys that this game aims to create.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The last and strangest ending is surely the goose ending. Some time throughout your escapades you may notice a friendly goose coasting by in the river. While you may pick this goose up and place it on the board to roam around, this doesn&rsquo;t have any impact on the game aside from making it more cute. If for some reason you attempt to drag the troll itself you&rsquo;ll find that it is actually possible; furthermore if you place your nemesis on top of the goose while it floats around the river, it will actually carry the troll away, freeing up your path to cross the bridge. Equally unexpected and lovely, it&rsquo;s the little things that count in a game like this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The final motivation that will push you to unpack the remainder of what the game has to offer is in the achievements. These heavily call back to the old days of achievements that actually encouraged you to play the game differently. Challenges like &ldquo;Regal Royale&rdquo; where you have to cause the black queen to get moved repeatedly twelve times consecutively or &ldquo;Triple Kill&rdquo; where you have to capture three black pieces in one move. These achievements essentially create unique and satisfying mini-puzzles for you to uncover and complete while in turn giving more breath to the game which is absolutely welcome.</span></p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p><span >King of the Bridge is a short game that will make you laugh and smile all the way through. A knowledge based puzzle game where learning the hidden rules is a core part of the experience. Relish in your discovery of new rules and laugh past your blunders while you overturn stone after stone of pure creativity. You can only really play this game once while the rules are obfuscated from you so just sit back, enjoy the ride, and don&rsquo;t lose your honor. </span></p>
