                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >A clean minimalist aesthetic paves the way for you to design the most efficient road system for some of the biggest cities in the world! Pick between different construction resources to connect randomly spawned houses and businesses together before demand overruns supply.</span></p>
            </section>

                <p><span >The core gameplay consists of placing road tiles, highways, traffic lights, and roundabouts to connect colored houses to businesses of the same color. Cars will be dispatched from houses to any business that has demand and is connected by a contiguous road. Pseudorandom spawns of houses and businesses will quickly turn your neatly placed roads into a sprawling entanglement of cars, roads, and bridges. As businesses generate demand, cars will begin the round trip journey to fulfill that demand. The rate of demand for each business increases over time, and when a business is at maximum demand capacity a timer starts. If the demand is not satisfied by cars by the end of the timer, your run of that level will end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >You&rsquo;ll do this for different levels which take the shape of a different major city found throughout the world! Navigate the grid system of New York City, carefully plan your bridge construction about the square river in Thailand, and build out serpentine roads throughout the mountains of Rio de Janeiro. There are plenty of levels that all add a little bit of flavor to the core gameplay and push you to adapt which can turn a relatively simple premise into quite the exciting challenge!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There were several levels where I was frantically deleting and replacing roads just to get the last few cars to complete their trips to hit the score goal I was aiming for. Quite the rush for a game that appears to be pretty chill and relaxing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The game has a completely minimalistic art style with only neutral colors aside from the cars and business but works quite well for a clean and satisfying experience.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >While this may feel like a game that you can leave on a second monitor while doing something else, you&rsquo;ll quickly find that there is actually a decent demand on your attention to keep up with rapid city expansion and growing business demand. This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, just know that this isn&rsquo;t fully a sit back and watch the show kind of game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Also if you like to have everything be perfectly ordered, the pseudo-random spawning in this game might drive you up the wall. Sometimes a red house gets placed where you wanted to build your purple house road, tough luck.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There actually isn&rsquo;t a soundtrack for this game, so instead I&rsquo;ll talk about the sound design! This ends up being a crucial part of the game since the minimalist design and lack of active gameplay focus your attention onto the small details. The puttering of cars, the clacking as you place road tiles, soft dings as new customer demands popup, and brief whisks as you remove paths to make room for new ones all contribute to a tight yet cohesive sound design which very much finds a home in a game like Mini Motorways. These sounds in addition to the soft synthetic whirs upon selecting resources for the next week set the ideal backdrop for exhibiting your mastery of city planning and transportation design.</span></p>

                <p><b>This is the point of no return, where we'll discuss parts of the game that are SPOILERS. <br> Turn back now if you're not ready!</b></p>

                <!-- Section for Spoiler Content -->
                <section id="content">
                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >There aren&rsquo;t really any spoilers here but just to be cautious, surpassing the goal for each city unlocks challenges and completing the goal for at least one challenge unlocks expert mode for that city. The first element that gets changed here is that you only get 8 weeks of unique materials to build with, after that it's all road tiles. The second and more alarming change is that all tiles you place are now permanent. No more shaping your roads with each new business spawn or refactoring your entire city architecture to make it just a pinch more efficient. While this does make the game harder, expert mode essentially forces you to learn the underlying spawn behavior used in the game and manipulate that to your advantage. While this certainly can be satisfying to some, it is quite the change of pace from the normal or endless modes of the game.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >Speaking of endless mode, city beautification enthusiasts can rejoice as endless mode removes the requirement of satisfying business demand and allows you to build the most aesthetically pleasing city you can imagine. Symmetric roads and inefficient yet satisfying traffic control are in the palm of your hands with this addition that truly lets you relax in a game that can otherwise prove to be stressful at times.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The additional complexity that is gradually introduced to you in the form of mountainous regions that require tunnels and trade cities that have train deliveries provides welcome diversity to the game and prevents it from feeling too stagnant. This combined with the multitude of different city layouts as well as daily and weekly challenges actually provides a solid amount of content to get through!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There was no greater feeling in my playthrough of the game than seeing a motorway pop up at the end of a week when I needed it most, allowing me to build a highway to let cars soar across any obstruction straight to their destinations. Finding the most efficient use of your limited resources was a fun problem to overcome and seeing it all come together in a well run city was the cherry on top of this experience.</span></p>

                <p><span >If you&rsquo;re looking for a relatively chill simulation game where you embrace your inner city planner this is the place for you! I&rsquo;d say that being a fan of micromanagement certainly will increase your enjoyment of this game because it really does come down to squeezing the most out of what you&rsquo;re given. Perfectionists can build their ideal road infrastructure with no pressure while those who want to offer themselves up to randomly placed structures with no second chances can play that way too. </span></p>
