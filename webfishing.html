                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >A chatroom where you catch different fish alongside your friends while playing as a cute animal. This is basically like Animal Crossing if it was just fishing, a little lo-fi, and the multiplayer actually worked well.</span></p>
            </section>

                <p><span >The game doesn&rsquo;t do anything too groundbreaking, but a good sense of humor, endearing writing, and a few friends onboard will set you up for an absolutely joyful time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The fishing loop itself is actually new, when you find a catch there will be multiple &ldquo;yank zones&rdquo; where you have to click the requisite number of times to continue reeling. Complete all zones successfully and voila, a fish (or mammal, or crustacean&hellip; you get it)! This is a pretty active task and since there is a time limit before the fish gets away,&nbsp; you&rsquo;ll have to be locked in if you want to secure every catch. What you can catch depends on the body of water, the weather, and the kind of bait you use; standard stuff. Catching fish gets you experience which unlocks upgrades and new customization for your character. Selling fish gets you money to buy the aforementioned upgrades, outfits, and other gadgets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Rinse and repeat this loop while buying funny hats and new shirts while you and your friends just sit on the dock fishing and chatting, a solid recipe for success.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Leveling up is slow but that makes total sense for a chatroom game where you&rsquo;re meant to play with others over a period of time while talking or focusing on other things. In a similar vein, catching every type of fish will take hundreds of hours and I&rsquo;m serious about that claim. Fair warning before you set out on such an endeavor.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For a game that is meant to be chill and played while talking to friends or on the side, catching the higher rarities of fish is pretty demanding! Having to click hundreds of times to get that fish you&rsquo;ve been waiting for can be rough, and if you miss it you might have to wait hours before finding it again. Grinding out every fish in the game is actually a gargantuan task, I definitely wouldn&rsquo;t recommend trying to actively pursue this. Just play alongside friends and enjoy the new catches as they arise.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >There isn&rsquo;t much content in this OST and the majority of time you spend in the game won&rsquo;t have music playing. The instrumentation is pretty bare bones with an acoustic guitar, some synth mallet instruments, a bass, and a drum made up of just white noise similar to the original Super Mario Bros. You&rsquo;ve got the nostalgic and longing nature of the &ldquo;Title Screen&rdquo; theme followed by a lone guitar strumming away in &ldquo;Sorrow&rdquo; as you wait patiently for rain specific fish to find your line. And of course you have &ldquo;Dinky&rdquo; which is the most frequent song you&rsquo;ll hear throughout your time in the game, especially if you play with others. Simple yet playful with enough space to chat with your friends and focus on fishing, perfectly dinky.</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >Two tracks to cover here in the spoiler zone: &ldquo;Fuibi&rdquo; and &ldquo;Together&rdquo;. To be honest, I have absolutely no clue where in the game &ldquo;Fuibi&rdquo; plays and the documentation for this soundtrack is incredibly sparse so it&rsquo;s hard to find more information. Regardless, this is something that absolutely could have come straight from Minecraft and it works incredibly well for the reflective moments that Webfishing can offer. The synthetic recorder and echoing synth playing an arpeggiated bassline in &frac34; time creates a bouncy yet lagging feeling mixed with hints of positivity. If I were to choose where this would play in the game, I would perhaps put it in situations like: Immediately after a rare event happens; occasionally when you run out of bait; when you are far from all other players in the game; when you are on the outskirts of the map. These gaps in time that follow a specific moment are a perfect place to situate a track like this. Hollow enough to allow you room to breathe and recover but hopeful enough to motivate you to continue forwards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Together&rdquo; is the song that plays when you are in the Void. The Void is a biome only accessible via a &ldquo;glitch&rdquo; but this is intentional, hence the quotes around glitch. Grab yourself a private island flag, place it out of bounds, warp to it and back and watch as you fall through the world to the bottom, only surrounded by darkness; fishable darkness. This track is nearly completely empty as it should be, populated only by ethereal synths and a very light electric guitar. Heavy use of sustained notes and allowing sounds to naturally fade as they gradually diminish through the empty space further reinforce the vapid nothingness around you. But why is it called &ldquo;Together&rdquo; you may ask? Because of the friends you bring with you to explore the unknown together </span><span >&mdash; or at the very least get a chance to catch the one fish that lives in the void to complete your journal.</span></p>

                    <p><span >Looking over your shoulder and seeing a 2D whale sprite bigger than the entire island is never boring, and watching the animation to pocket it in your little character&rsquo;s inventory (and allowing everyone to see again) is just so goofy and perfect for this game. The Animal Crossing homage continues as you get a unique pun for each catch. You&rsquo;ve got lovable, derpy characters like Beeg Frog, Shady Possum, and Judgemental Fox. Pair that with your friends who rock up wearing a &ldquo;Smok&eacute;Mon&rdquo; shirt and clown nose while clapping playing a MIDI guitar and then you get a classic Webfishing experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There are 6 rarities of fish represented by star levels going up to 5-star: normal, shining, glistening, opulent, radiant, and alpha. Each creature also has a tier which further alters the odds of catching a specific kind of fish. Even with the </span><em><span >highest </span></em><span >tier bait, the chance of an Alpha rarity fish is only 5%! Even with the sparkling lure, it does not drastically improve your odds here. As a result, the final achievement of the game to complete every alpha entry in your journal will require an immense amount of time. Each catch also has a size ranging from extra small to extra large, which in addition to the other attributes will increase the amount of clicks required to net your catch. These numbers can get quite high, requiring up to 10,000 clicks (without rod modifiers), so be prepared to mash.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Buckets are your saving grace if you&rsquo;re looking to catch all fish rarities without losing your sanity. These are idle contraptions that will provide you a catch every so often. Unfortunately without glitches you can only have 2 buckets placed at a time (one saltwater and one freshwater) but it is much better than having to fish everything yourself.</span></p>

                <p><span >If you&rsquo;re looking for a chill social experience or second game to play with your friends, Webfishing is a pretty fun option. It's simple and goofy but can still provide you with plenty of entertaining moments. Viewed as a single player experience the game can still hold up somewhat if you aren&rsquo;t looking for something too deep, but the real fun comes from entering this sandbox with others and seeing what happens next.</span></p>
