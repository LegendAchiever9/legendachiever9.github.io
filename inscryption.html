                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >It&rsquo;s a deckbuilding roguelite but not in the way you&rsquo;d expect! This is a narratively driven adventure where you find yourself sitting in a dark wooden cabin sitting across from your captor. I promise you will not be able to guess what happens next.</span></p>

                <p><span >The tone set by this game right on the opener is immaculate. A relaxing yet deeply ominous and ethereal ambient soundtrack is seemingly all that accompanies you in a dimly lit cavern filled with trinkets and odd corridors. Mood established, nothing else to say here:)</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >The game presents itself pretty clearly as a card battler. You have a turn where you draw a card and play as many cards as you wish within your resource restriction. Once you&rsquo;re done, all cards automatically attack the spot in front of them, nothing crazy. One interesting difference is that cards don&rsquo;t take damage when they attack, they simply deal their attack value to the opposing card. If there is no opposing card, you deal direct damage to your opponent, standard stuff. Another small change is that the player health in this game is rubber banded: that is to say if you are hit for 1 damage and subsequently deal 2 damage, the net health will be 1 damage against your opponent &mdash; the health is &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; between you and your opponent. The gameplay is simple but is fun and works super well amongst everything around it. That&rsquo;s it, those are all the rules; from there you just play and discover new cards as you go. All told as a sort of tabletop story by your opponent in this card game who also happens to be the reason why you&rsquo;re stuck there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >If you&rsquo;re looking for a break between the card game, why don&rsquo;t you take a stroll around the cabin? There&rsquo;s plenty to poke around at and see what you can find. This presents a second game, or series or minigames if you will, that you can engage with to advance the story along with the core card battling loop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The story for this game is presented in quite the unconventional way, you&rsquo;ll need to keep your wits about you to keep the threads straight. Similar to Undertale or One Shot, this game sports a meta-narrative on top of its main storyline by way of some unique ideas. The game will transform as you go from act to act, but the core gameplay remains the same so your intuition and learned skills will continue as you progress.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There isn&rsquo;t much more I can say here so expect a bit of a lengthy Point of No Return.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <p><span >Not getting into too much detail, I think the game starts off with its strongest piece. This isn&rsquo;t inherently a complaint, but I think the bar is set incredibly high right out the gate and it is difficult to keep up with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >If you&rsquo;re looking for a straightforward story, this isn't it. By no means does it obfuscate the plot as much as a Fromsoft game, but it certainly isn&rsquo;t easy to grasp everything that&rsquo;s going on around you. That combined with its unconventional methods of storytelling and you have a definitely memorable experience, but not simple if that is what you&rsquo;re after.</span></p>

                <p><span >Continuing the notion of going against the grain, the soundtrack is strange but amazingly solid and thematically perfect. The main cabin theme is so unsettling with the irregular synthetic groaning of the bass. Yet at the same time the delicate meandering of the guitar gives a sense of comfort and nostalgia. The key gives off tones of sorrow and mourning, and there are just enough shifting dissonant lines that crawl beneath the guitar that let you know that something is wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The standout themes in Act I are incredibly memorable and will make such an impact when you first encounter them. I am quite excited to discuss them further below:)</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >Alrighty here we go, three of the four Act I bosses have some of the most memorable amusical themes you&rsquo;ll ever hear accompanied by fitting visuals that set the tone for the sequence.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The Angler is mostly just ambient fishing sounds but there is something so visceral about the trawling of a fishing line, the swiping of knives ready to carve, the echoing bells in a decrescendo, the ethereal synth floating in the background, and of course the lone bass striking two beats, DUM BOM.</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >The Trapper goes from being your comforting ally of the wilderness to your latest pursuer: the scraping and peeling of hide from bone as an armory of knives levitate behind him and of course an almost hypnotic deep humming of the main melody. Then the guitar and drums kick in to establish what can only loosely be called a groove while the sounds of a trapper&rsquo;s craft go on and on.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >And of course, Leshy himself sporting my song of the game. The absolute depressing tones of the synth that remain as eeries as ever. Clattering tin drums and the occasional bass drum hit define our rhythm and the wispy noises above the main line contribute to the surreal atmosphere. A bridge where only the synth remains on top of a rising electric sustained chord take us into the magical moment where the piano first joins in. This piano is dissonant, unsettling, and perfectly placed in this theme. It gets doubled by a lower piano octave that is just slightly delayed. Then the higher octave gets delayed in a rapid change, followed closely by the Angler&rsquo;s theme poking its head back in, thematically fitting with the in game hook being played by Leshy. And last but not least in this theme is the return of our woeful guitar from the cabin theme on top of Leshy&rsquo;s theme combing back on the synth. Absolute cinema as you fight for you life in this ending sequence to Act I</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >For the rest of the game the music continues its ambient nature and is still good, though I feel Act I stands above the rest here as well. Some noteworthy elements are &ldquo;The Scrybe of Beasts&rdquo; in Act II of course bringing back Leshy&rsquo;s theme, but in a 16-bit sound fitting for this section of the game. &ldquo;The Scrybe of Magicks&rdquo; in Act II came out of nowhere with its almost uplifting quality. Quite different from the rest of the scribes, I think the slight joy that this piece can bring is what makes it standout. It&rsquo;s also a bit of a bop, what can I say. &ldquo;Uberbot Activated&rdquo; in Act III is atonal, amusical, but absolutely raw. I can&rsquo;t really describe this well and it&rsquo;s a lot of noise but I think it deserves some credit for the effect it creates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I&rsquo;ll give the final sequence theme its own section here, this reprise of the original cabin theme is heavy. Not in a musical sense as this track is sparsely populated and it only pokes its head out with the gentlest strums of a guitar. But the emptiness speaks volumes and when paired with the slow disappearance of everything that you&rsquo;ve grown accustomed to in this game, it can pack quite the emotional punch. Rest in peace Leshy, you just wanted to tell a good story.</span></p>

                    <p><span >Speaking of the story, it&rsquo;s quite solid and actually succeeds in making you feel what the scribes went through. Regardless of who you side with, everything takes you into Act III in your stand against PO3, though you may even start to feel some empathy towards it as well. The bizarre story telling method of a game within a game in addition to the &ldquo;real life&rdquo; developer logs definitely are memorable but I would not say are my favorite. I found Act I to be extremely compelling from its own narrative, but tying the greater picture together definitely creates a more interesting plot to engage with and it&rsquo;s a clever idea.</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >Act II has you playing an old school, pixel graphics version of the original Inscryption. This card collector and puzzle hybrid was pretty fun though it did get to be a bit tedious at times. I enjoyed the Magnificus tower escape room though and who doesn&rsquo;t love opening card packs to collect them all?</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >Act III is basically Act I against but you play in a dystopian robot future called Botopia. Navigate through different screens as you search for resources and engage in combat. This 2D open world was interesting to explore and filled with secrets from a lore and gameplay perspective. A cool feature here was that if you win several battles consecutively without dying, you&rsquo;ll accrue a bounty. This will trigger bounty hunters to come after you in the form of extra powerful cards that can join a regular encounter. These were pretty compelling and a nice change of pace from the main loop of this section.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I think I mostly miss the cabin part of Act I, where you have to engage with the out-of-game world to affect your progression. Those escape room and detective portions were excellent and I would&rsquo;ve loved for them to continue that line more. Instead, the meta narrative takes the lead which isn&rsquo;t my personal preference but still delivers an effective and ultimately impactful story to the player.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >After you complete the game you unlock &ldquo;Kaycee&rsquo;s Mod&rdquo; which is essentially a fully encompassed roguelite version of Act I. There are some changes, but mostly it fully expands Act I into its own game which is quite enjoyable! It's pretty simple and straightforward, but the challenges needed to unlock more decks in addition to the engaging core gameplay loop were certainly compelling enough to keep me playing. If you enjoyed Act I and hunger for more, this is a great treat at the end of the game to keep you around for some more card battling and great music.</span></p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p><span >If unique plots or meta-narratives interest you, absolutely give this a go. Take a fun yet simple deck building game, add in some clever storytelling and a phenomenal tone-setting environment then you have a visceral and impactful game here. Act I is phenomenal so it&rsquo;s a tough one to follow, but the game lands well if you&rsquo;re able to keep up with what&rsquo;s happening around you. One of a kind experience and one you won&rsquo;t regret trying out!</span></p>
