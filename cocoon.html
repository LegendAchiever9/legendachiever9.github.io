                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Cocoon is an atmospheric puzzle game where eerily natural, synthetic worlds are contained within orbs &mdash; worlds that you can enter, carry, and nest inside one another. It&rsquo;s a masterfully crafted experience from the creator of Inside that will take you through an incomprehensibly foreign landscape filled with elegant, minimalist puzzles and uncanny life.</span></p>

                <p><span >The core gameplay of Cocoon is simple, you walk around the world and find the next place you can reach. The catch is that each world is contained within an orb, one that you can pickup and carry around once you get access to it. Hopping out of a world, using the orb to open a gate, and relocating the orb to jump in somewhere else is the main flow of the game. You can already see how puzzles can start to form in this premise, but puzzles are not the main strongsuit of the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The puzzles are by no means weak as they are brilliantly elegant in their simplicity. The game is linear though and the overall option space for possibilities that pertain to each puzzle is quite narrow. While this means the puzzles won&rsquo;t be immensely satisfying to solve in isolation, the seamless integration they have with the world along with the relatively novel concept make them a joy to progress through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The world of Cocoon hits you with an oxymoronic style: synthetic yet organic, alien yet familiar. This contradiction thrives throughout your experience and it&rsquo;s one of the most staggeringly creative environments that I&rsquo;ve seen. While the puzzles are solid, they take a backseat to the spectacle of the environments and creatures found throughout the very much alive world. You have animal-like creatures that seem to be made of inorganic materials yet can plug into larger systems: like a tall, crawling creature moving on its own with conduit-like armor. Side by side with that you&rsquo;ll see constructions that mimic nature: a robot sprouting butterfly wings, cables that slither and wind like a snake, or massive platforms that grow legs and move around like an active hermit crab.This bizarre world state is a large part of what makes the environment dynamic and greatly enhances your traversal from point to point to complete the next puzzle. The world itself also seems to be part of this dynamism as it will morph, strain, and stretch as you prod around and bring change. These surreal flourishes make traversal as much a highlight as the regular progression of the game itself.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >The puzzles are quite straightforward for most of the game and remain linear until the final stretch. It&rsquo;s a great entry point for new players, but seasoned puzzle fans might crave more challenge. Don&rsquo;t expect a Baba is You level of puzzle game when you approach Cocoon, but there is still plenty to enjoy. The experience isn't meant to be a complex tangle where you struggle to find out where to go next &mdash; it&rsquo;s about the mystery, wonder, and absorption of what the worlds have to offer. I really don&rsquo;t have much more to say here, just go in with this expectation and you&rsquo;ll have a wondrous experience.</span></p>

            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The most unique thing about Cocoon&rsquo;s soundtrack is that it doesn&rsquo;t have a fixed OST &mdash; all music in the game is generative. That means there's no prearranged score; the atmospheric music is dynamically created as you play. Nothing I heard in my playthrough will exactly match what you heard in yours.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >This approach elegantly solves a long-standing issue in game audio design: how do you create an immersive musical experience when the player controls the pacing? In traditional composition, you&rsquo;re always fighting the disconnect between player behavior and music structure, whether it&rsquo;s an area transition or simply standing idle. Some games mask it well, others even design around it, but Cocoon takes a completely different route.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Each zone in the game is assigned a set of generative rules tailor-made for its aesthetics as a kind of sound profile, if you will. These rules drive digital instruments to generate evolving synthesizer lines, filling space with tones that feel alive, reactive, and true to the environment. It won&rsquo;t work for every game, but in Cocoon&rsquo;s surreal, unfamiliar world, this alien, almost amusical soundscape fits like a glove.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >That said, not all audio is generative, and this is where the game&rsquo;s sound design really shines. Puzzle completions, scripted moments, cutscenes, creature animations, and environmental shifts are all paired with intentional, composed audio cues. These elements break through the generative ambience in precise ways to create a musical emphasis that draws attention without ever becoming intrusive. The use of reverb-heavy hits, deep bass swells, and layered harmonies are some of the voicing techniques you&rsquo;ll hear throughout your journey that make Cocoon stand out when compared to standard game soundtracks.</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >Each orb throughout the game houses a distinct biome and musical identity. The Factory, or white orb, is industrial and mechanical, perfectly matching the robotic surroundings you traverse. The Desert world, or orange orb, feels spacious and mystical, with synthesizers playing runs and glissandos up and down as you move through it. The Swamp, or green orb, carries a calm and natural aura, filled with long tones, rich harmonies, and a rainforest-like ambiance. The Organic world, or purple orb, is more sparse, creating room for eerily natural sound design evocative of natural beings. Finally, the Overworld is vacant and cosmic, filled with long, resonant chords that echo across the vast space within it.</span></p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >The white orb reveal is nothing short of awesome, as what you&rsquo;ve expected to be the overworld is actually shown to be just another world amongst the plethora you&rsquo;ve engaged with. Nothing too crazy but a fun moment that leaves a lasting impression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >It&rsquo;s not super common for puzzle games to have Boss fights but the encounters in cocoon match the tone and energy of the game quite well. A creeping bassline adds more pressure than the normal themes of each orb and the mechanics of each boss fully echo the new power introduced by the orb. The boss designs match the environment of the game by having both realistic, grounding features mixed with strange, eldritch-like qualities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The moon ancestors fully lean into the more lovecraftian design albeit with a more mechanical twist and make up the side objectives of Cocoon. These are usually slightly off the beaten path areas that require a sequence input that is somehow displayed in the world. The lake reflection moon ancestor was one of my favorites here as it provided an excellent discovery moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The final puzzle is a cute way to end the game by requiring you to fully nest all the orbs and is one of the most exciting puzzles to logic your way through. The puzzles found throughout the end of the game were certainly the most fun for me, really requiring you to take some time to think about how you would approach the challenge in front of you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As you may expect with a game by the creator of Inside, the ending and hidden ending are both totally left up to the player for interpretation. The hidden ending is an absolute&nbsp; doozy to complete and I wouldn't expect literally anyone to discover this obscure secret on their own. Throughout the game there are six helper drone dispensers that require a sequence to unlock as we discussed earlier for the moon ancestors. These sequences actually serve a third purpose which is required for the secret ending: these six locations are matched with six other locations all around the game that are found near a collection of blue triangles in the environment. In each of these spots, there is a cryptic puzzle to solve that is fully contained in the environment and only used for this meta puzzle. Each location has three combinations to input at the drones and once completing all six, the next time you roll the credits you&rsquo;ll be met with an extra cutscene to cap off your experience &mdash; insane.</span></p>

You will be continuously amazed and delightfully confused as you explore a dream you don&rsquo;t fully understand, but don&rsquo;t want to wake up from.</span></p>
