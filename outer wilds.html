                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Happy Launch Day! It&rsquo;s finally time for you to prepare for your first space flight as a member of the Outer Wilds Ventures exploration team. Let your curiosity guide you as you explore a tightly knit solar system filled with creative destinations and fragments of the past.</span></p>
            </section>

                <p><span >This is an exploration game where you scour the solar system to piece together an overarching story and find your role in everything. There isn&rsquo;t an explicit objective to complete or a massive &ldquo;save the world&rdquo; quest; rather you&rsquo;ll discover bits of information in the form of &ldquo;rumors&rdquo; and set out to learn more about them. One chunk of knowledge will raise more questions than it answers, and this presents the core gameplay loop of the game. Ask a question, go look for an answer, unearth more questions, and continue onwards until the full plot of the game slowly reveals itself to you. If you see a cool planet or weird occurrence, nothing stops you from heading there as fast as you can fly (without crashing) to go investigate. Just don&rsquo;t forget to take some time to stop and listen to the music from your fellow team members.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The game takes great inspiration from science and does a phenomenal job at providing a grounded and consistent physics experience, even if it isn&rsquo;t quite realistic. Playing around with the physics mechanics in the game is fun in and of itself and slowly gaining mastery over flying your ship just might convince you that you were cut out for space travel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The art is heavily stylized which ends up working quite well to create charming environments with just the right amount of detail</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t say much else due to the nature of this game so either go play it or venture past the point of no return if you&rsquo;ve already finished the game.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >There is very little to say here, the two points I&rsquo;ll make are quite general. First off, if you get motion sick easily, this game might be a challenge. You&rsquo;ll be navigating all 360 degrees through space with the ability to roll your ship &ldquo;upside down&rdquo; which can certainly pose an issue if you&rsquo;re sensitive to that. </span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >Second point is actually one of the main draws of the game but it can be a downside for some: if you like having a clear objective and knowing how to accomplish it, this game will put you far outside of that comfort zone. Nevertheless, I would recommend you to embrace that newness and give this awe-inspiring journey a chance.</span></p>

            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >&ldquo;Timber Hearth&rdquo; is the epitome of comfort and nostalgia. The acoustic guitar intro feels so familiar and whenever you come back to Timber Hearth you&rsquo;ll be filled with a sense of warmth and homecoming as this tune greets your arrival. Soft electric guitars play sparse notes over strumming and an ambient background. The scattered synth notes of the bridge, high wind note, and plucked low strings give a brief interlude to allow you time to reflect and ponder your next wondrous adventure. A perfect starting track for your home planet.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Main Title&rdquo; is what you think of when the Outer Wilds soundtrack is mentioned. The dinky yet soulful acoustic guitar and legato cello provide a lovely foundation to build the iconic melody at 0:21. In the key of A major we get tones of hope, love and serenity. This song will become home to you soon enough; an incredibly simple melody that repeats every 4 bars and two of those bars are repeated in that time frame. So simple and the last bar is designed to loop straight back into the first so the tune can repeat as long as needed. Elegant and perfect for what it&rsquo;s meant to be.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The music on the different planets knows when to take a step back and just be atmospheric. Space is empty of course, so leaving room for the atmosphere and surroundings to breathe is plenty. The piece &ldquo;Space&rdquo;&nbsp; does this quite well; aside from starting with a faster version of the main motif, it is minimal in the placement of notes and mostly relies on ethereal atmospheric sounds mixed with some familiar instruments to remind you of home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >In a similar sense, certain tracks will evoke feelings of discomfort and isolation; you&rsquo;re traveling through the solar system alone and that can certainly be scary at times. Having the music step back and sometimes even be eerie helps make the familiar moments more safe and comforting when you reach them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The use of no music and empty space in certain areas does wonders in allowing the sections </span><em><span >with </span></em><span >music to be that much more impactful. Sometimes silence is the most powerful music we can offer.</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >Before we get into specific tracks, the use of instrumentation as a motif in this game is great. You have the instruments of the outer wilds members, of course, and the acoustic guitar representing the Hearthians. Then you have the piano as the instrument representing the Nomai; note how it is only present when you explore the ruins of Nomai civilization or are using their technology. And finally we have the cello as the instrument representing the new universe that comes to be.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >At 1:21 into &ldquo;Castaways&rdquo; you&rsquo;ll hear that piano presence but in a different way. This distorted and filtered piano plays when you reach the core of the Interloper and the Nomai Grave in Dark Bramble; shocking moments that portray the sudden end of a civilization in striking plainness. Happening across these sites is gut wrenchingly sad, and this melody in E minor is very clear in portraying a mood of introspection and mourning.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The reveal at the sun station is one of immense tragedy and humility. Of the course of the game we hear about the plan to power the Ash Twin Project using the sun station to actively cause the sun to go supernova. Pair that with the realization that the sun going supernova is what ends each loop leads you to thinking that the Nomai were successful, and that finding a way to shut down the station is the key to saving the solar system. But then a harsh truth is disclosed, the sun station failed. The sun going supernova is just due to its natural lifespan, and your presence in the galaxy at this time is pure coincidence; there is </span><em><span >nothing </span></em><span >you can do to stop it. This is a brutal yet sobering moment of the game that forces you to come to terms with letting things go; sometimes there isn&rsquo;t a magical way to make everything better, you simply must accept that the universe is, and we are.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The &ldquo;Sun Station&rdquo; theme holds a weight similar to the reveal that it accompanies. Mostly amusical and atmospheric, the wandering synths form harmonies that lead nowhere, much as your efforts to influence the fate of the solar system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There is a pretty neat reference you&rsquo;ll encounter as you board the sun station (through the intended path, not as a hotshot pilot). Once you fling the door off its hinges from the landing zone, you get a spitting image of Capa&rsquo;s jump from the movie &ldquo;Sunshine&rdquo; (2007). This sequence parallels the plot of the movie in many ways and is a great homage to another piece of media that acts as a love letter to the vastness of space that is out of our control.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >You&rsquo;ll quickly grow accustomed to &ldquo;End Times&rdquo; as the music that plays at the end of a loop. An ethereal collage of synths with a sense of finality presents a soundscape that represents happenings much greater than yourself. Until you remove the warp core, and now all of a sudden a universe locked into recursion as a final hope of finding the answer to a species&rsquo; insatiable curiosity is in your control. For the first and only time, you alone have the agency to alter the path of the universe. At this moment we hear the song &ldquo;Final Voyage&rdquo;, which starts with a long suspended high note backed by a fast moving synth bassline. Then our tried and true &ldquo;End Times&rdquo; theme comes back but with a new sense of purpose and momentum. This track has direction; a gradual crescendo of the background atmospheric noise and increased pitch of the synth as the piece loops really shows that this is </span><em><span >the </span></em><span >end.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Travelers&rdquo; plays at the final campfire once you&rsquo;ve reached the Eye of the Universe and of course brings back the main motif we heard all the way back in &ldquo;Main Title&rdquo;. This last moment to reflect on the life you and the members of outer wilds ventures held is incredibly special, and what better way to spend it than with a new friend. Finding each of your friends with an ode of what made them unique is an amazing moment (except for Feldspar, why does he have to scare you like that) when paired with the gradual buildup of the song. Notice that the piano joins the tune if you&rsquo;ve met Solanum on the Quantum Moon and let her share her memories with you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;14.3 Billion Years&rdquo; is the credits song and brilliantly features the interplay between the guitar and the cello; phrased differently, it shows the transition from the Hearthians and Nomai to the beginnings of a brand new universe. At 2:14 the guitar melody and supporting cello drop out for some quantum background noise in a relatively vacant bridge. Fast strings then bring forward a new moment of hope and excitement until it all suddenly cuts out into 3:09. At this moment a lone guitar plays the main motif one last time before handing things over to the cello. We get a beautiful sweeping melody filled with raw emotion. Whereas the cello supported the guitar in the first half, the cello now takes the full lead with the guitar providing supporting padding.4:06 gives us a legato reprise of the main motif with the last note as the cello and high strings fully take over this track and turn it into something new; their own new campfire song.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Right after the credits, the track &ldquo;Morning&rdquo; opens up as a reprise of the &ldquo;Timber Hearth&rdquo;; an extremely fitting line that lets us remember our origins on Timber Hearth at the end of one universe, but creates a variation on that theme marking the start of a new one. A new origin for a new wealth of life to arise and flourish on their own path.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay so &ldquo;Let There Be Light&rdquo; actually (and I suppose obviously) takes place before the credits but I had to talk about this last: the big bang sequence after the final campfire is a musical masterpiece and I claim it to be one of the greatest musical payouts in gaming. </span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >You&rsquo;ve spent the entire game, your entire journey into learning all you can about the universe, listening to the song of the outer wilds ventures: five Hearthians playing a simple melody, trapped in an endless loop (both themselves and the song itself). I mentioned earlier that the melody is 4 bars broken into 2 phrases that both start out the same way. The second phrase starts ascending but then comes back down to the third of the scale (which does not provide any closure to the chord) on the last note to nicely loop the song ad infinitum. But this time around, the last note does not go down to the third and leave us hanging as we start another loop. This time, the last note continues that ascending line into the first note of the scale but up an octave, which finally resolves the chord progression of the main motif. This is the first and only time for this to happen in the entire game which provides a stunningly impactful sense of resolution to the game. After all is said and done, the universe ends to be born anew, and representing the closing of that chapter by finally resolving the chord of the main motif that has been left open this whole time is pure poetry. Top that off with the fact that the notes are extended to be twice as long, played by a high pitched synth that cuts straight to your soul and massive drum hits on the strong beats of the phrase, and you have just an absolutely phenomenal ending as you birth a new universe with a literal big bang.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >Okay well that&rsquo;s the music covered, so let's talk actual gameplay shall we? After you hopefully explored the village on Timber Hearth, the game really opens up. You&rsquo;re basically free to explore any part of the world that you please and you will find a point of interest to help guide you. Similar to other open world games, you are given a starting suggestion in the form of visiting the Attlerock and subsequently finding Gabbro on Giant&rsquo;s Deep, but if you would prefer to go elsewhere that is supported. After this initial direction however, you&rsquo;re fully on your own; take the information that you discover and use it to determine where to explore next. This treasure hunt style of play is quite compelling and really enforces the idea that you are a space archaeologist striving to figure out what happened to the Nomai civilization and what is the strange statue from the beginning of the game. These two elements, of course, are tightly intertwined as you slowly uncover the secrets of the past.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The game excels in reveals, and your first time breaching the atmosphere of Giant&rsquo;s Deep is no exception. As you duck below the thick clouds you&rsquo;re greeted with the sight of several large tornados sweeping across the horizon. Such a cool moment that finds a great balance between awe and anxiety. Giant&rsquo;s Deep serves as a sort of hub in the game&rsquo;s progression, as you&rsquo;ll need to revisit this planet several times after learning new information. The first of which is actually one of my favorite &ldquo;puzzles&rdquo; in the game, the tornado observation. I put quotes around the word puzzle since the intended path is just you going to the Southern Observatory and being explicitly told that there is one tornado that turns anticlockwise. That being said however, it is totally feasible for an astute viewer to notice this pattern and investigate on their own &mdash; super cool. Once you solve this piece you&rsquo;ll be met with another impassable current that requires information from another castle (or infested seed, in this case). Learning about the jellyfish maneuver is a humorous moment but actually executing it is not; leaving the safety of your ship whilst underwater in the deep core of Giant&rsquo;s Deep to swim into the bell of a jellyfish is unnerving to say the least and really leans into your necessary trust of science and discovery. Finishing this step then gives you one of the most crucial elements to piecing together the story and of course, the coordinates to the eye of the universe.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another great reveal is on Brittle Hollow, assuming that you followed the relatively intended path of visiting the distress beacon first. Opening the door at the bottom of the Nomai ship only to watch it plummet down to the core of the planet and into a black hole is honestly just staggeringly cool. Not to mention the disorientation and wonder that ensues if you&rsquo;re brave enough to jump (or fall) in yourself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Finally getting into the Ash Twin Project is also a massive development; this puzzle in particular though can be frustrating and is on the less elegant side compared to the rest of the game. I really like the hint about the five degree tolerance but actually trying to figure out how to warp while avoiding the sand column isn&rsquo;t fully resolved by that clue. Using the scout to identify when the warp actually engages is the best way to verify your window, which is great if you had the thought to do so. Otherwise, it requires piecing together quite a few pieces of knowledge: the warp window lasts as long as the tower is within five degrees of the center of the body; the twins act as one body and share a center; warping is instantaneous if you step on the pad during the active window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >All of this is meant to imply that you should wait for the warp pad to activate and only step on it once it's active, even if the column of sand looms overhead awaiting your arrival. It&rsquo;s certainly not an unreasonable solution but it is by no means straightforward.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Your first visit to dark bramble is incredibly creepy (especially due to the lack of music and environmental sound design) and has you searching through a space-defying maze for a way through. I assume you were trying to find Feldspar by following your scout or his harmonica on the signalscope, but if not I can imagine this was a confusing and potentially awful experience due to the anglerfish. Fortunately, following Feldspar&rsquo;s signal through either method allows you to dodge the anglerfish in the first room and the second room actually has none so you can explore the duplicated signals without fear (if only you knew this at the time). Suffice it to say that finally reaching his camp was an absolute relief with a great payout of finally wrapping up the last Giant&rsquo;s Deep rumor. In my playthrough I delayed Dark Bramble as long as possible, only going when there was literally nothing else that I could do so I booked it to Feldspar as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Getting to the Vessel no matter how many&nbsp; times you do it will surely get your heart rate up due to how awfully close you have to get to the preying anglerfish. Even after learning that they are blind, the realization that you have to slowly float past them with residual momentum is an arduous and stressful experience which is very well done. Reaching the Vessel and seeing the coordinate input is a great moment assuming that you do this towards the end of the game and already have the coordinates; all that&rsquo;s left is to figure out how to get to the ATP for the warp core. Otherwise this can be a grand moment filled with new information, followed quickly by confusion until you get the coordinates.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The tower of quantum knowledge in Brittle Hollow&nbsp; is certainly one of the harder discoveries to make in the game and a truly great puzzle. As opposed to learning clear information that allows you to progress, you simply have to figure out how to get up this tower on your own. This is a departure from the core gameplay where you encounter an obstacle and need to find information on how to deal with it. Here, you are provided a true obstacle where the only way to get past it is by solving the puzzle yourself. Whether your eventual epiphany came from your scout showing the stability percentage of the planet or simply thinking about the collapsing debris, this will certainly be a satisfying discovery to unveil your (likely) final quantum rule.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The quantum pilgrimage once you fully understand all three rules is quite the journey and likely will align somewhat with your progress throughout the game. Cresting the hill and seeing Solanum standing there is an absolutely surreal experience. Actually getting to meet a living (somewhat) Nomai after navigating nothing but ruins is a genuine gift and what makes this even more special is that you&rsquo;ve essentially &ldquo;watched&rdquo; Solanum grow up. From the sloppy scribbled Nomai writing in the school on Brittle hollow to the introspective philosophical musings of her adulthood we see a naive child gain an understanding and appreciation for the universe. Not getting to talk Solanum directly is an ironic sadness that is fortunately eclipsed by the maturity, wisdom, and insight that she provides.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The overall story isn&rsquo;t the easiest to wrap your head around but it is unique and a love letter to the principles of science. Coming to terms with the fact that the universe is ending isn&rsquo;t a light topic and links to a major theme around acceptance. The Nomai didn&rsquo;t had enough time to actually reflect on this but we see their growth as a species as they embrace their true nature as intrepid learners. Seeing their care for the primitive Hearthains and genuine passion for knowledge is both touching and tragic yet all culminates in a lovely ending that gives a different perspective on what it means to live.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The DLC &mdash; Echoes of the Eye &mdash; is a bit of a departure from the main game but certainly still has its excellent moments. I&rsquo;ll go over the sequences and elementsI really like in a bit, but first I&rsquo;ll cover what I found weaker throughout the DLC. Unfortunately, the core gameplay once you reach the simulation is what falls short compared to the base game for me: instead of exploring the lost ruins of the Nomai, you&rsquo;re tasked with a stealth challenge to dodge past the inhabitants in near complete darkness (most of the time). I found this segment to be much less compelling than the base game, and in fact a detractor from the puzzles and mystery instead of enhancing them. </span><span ><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span >The shrouded woodlands sequence has a cool puzzle within it: how to access the meeting house without any inhabitants around and not getting removed from the simulation yourself is a clever and unique experience. I just found it hard to physically see my surroundings well enough to naturally arrive at that conclusion without some frustration.</span><span ><br /></span><span ><br /></span><span >Endless Canyon and Starlit Cove I don&rsquo;t feel have too many redeeming qualities to them, as even when you eventually figure out the best route to take after stumbling around the darkness you still have to bait and run from the inhabitants to complete these puzzles. This &ldquo;mechanical&rdquo; check is something that the base game never really relied on, and I think these ending discoveries of the DLC suffer from it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay negativity done, on to the things that are done well and left an extremely strong lasting impression and right up to par with the base game experience. First off, the discovery of the Stranger from the radio tower is so cool. Watching an unidentifiable object slowly eclipse the sun as you follow the satellite trajectory sets a perfect stage for the DLC. Following this is an absolute highlight moment, which is the reveal of the Stranger&rsquo;s interior as you enter your first raft and drop into the current. The grandeur of an entire ring starship filled with trees and a running river smack dab in the middle of the solar system you&rsquo;ve grown comfortable in is ridiculous, awesome, and an unforgettable memory. The exploration that follows is solid; sifting through the decaying station for clues about the inhabitants&rsquo; past and finding more answers to how the Nomai arrived in their predicament surrounding the eye of the universe. All of this plays nicely with the strengths of the game and remains ever enjoyable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The final callout would be the ending which, assuming you&rsquo;ve fully filled your rumor map, is a delightfully charming and emotional sequence where we get to share all of our knowledge about the events of the game with the last remaining inhabitant. &ldquo;Echoes Of The Eye&rdquo; plays during this sequence and its just a beautiful moment that may even bring a tear to your eye; a reprise of the traveler&rsquo;s theme leitmotif occupies most of this scene, but once our character first appears in the vision the tried and true main theme takes front and center in both a heartwarming and heart wrenching way. This gets followed up with &ldquo;Departure&rdquo;, which plays when you see the final vision of the last inhabitant. And in what more fitting way would this play out than the two of you departing together, while the main theme plays on no other instrument than the theremin &mdash; the instrument which represents the inhabitants.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Even with the latter half of the DLC not being my favorite, the overall narrative connects so masterfully that I can&rsquo;t help but love the ending even in light of those flaws. It gives even more depth to the original story and delivers it for the most part in an astounding way.</span></p>
