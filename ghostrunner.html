                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Imagine a first person John Wick with a sword parkouring through cyberpunk cityscape levels with persistent dark synthwave beats and you have Ghostrunner. This game takes the Titanfall style movement techniques of wall runs and slide jumps and combines it with high octane, one hit-one kill gameplay like Katana Zero.</span></p>
            </section>

            <!-- Section for Content -->
            <section id="content">
                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >From the opening cutscene to the end of the game, Ghostrunner is clear in its purpose: you&rsquo;re a robotic samurai whose purpose is to efficiently kill. The levels are specifically designed to suit this fantasy from the parkour and platforming elements to the enemy placement. The core mechanics of the game can be broken down into combat and movement &mdash; with regards to the former, the main note is that attacks from you and the enemies are an instant kill; for the latter, your platforming capabilities come in the form of wall running, dashing, sliding, and grappling. There is one more key system that plays a big role throughout the game and that is &ldquo;sensory time&rdquo;, a bullet time-esque mechanic where you can briefly slow down time before dashing in any direction to cancel it. This provides you with finer control of your movement without sacrificing the fast-paced feeling of the game. All of this comes to life in each level where you&rsquo;ll be deciding how to string together your moves while slicing through a variety of enemies and scaling hazardous environments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Whenever a new enemy type is introduced, the level will start out with a few combat scenarios that have you face that enemy in an isolated context. This isn&rsquo;t the most seamless way of teaching the player but is definitely welcome especially given the fickle nature of certain enemy variants. Most of the levels are subdivided into segments that either lean towards slower paced, platforming sections or full combat sections. These solely movement based sequences mostly act as downtime to let you recover after an action packed battle and allow the characters to present the story to you throughout their dialogue. They act quite similarly to another intervention moment that occurs throughout the game in the form of Cybervoid segments: a mix of light puzzles and platforming with your abilities removed. While simple and quite different from the normal dynamic of the game, these are not too frequent and primarily serve as a medium to provide you with new abilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Speaking of abilities, aside from the core set I mentioned earlier, you&rsquo;ll progressively unlock special abilities that have cooldowns. These are quite strong and also represent your only ranged options in combat which will become a crucial component of your toolkit. We&rsquo;ll discuss more of these in the spoiler section, but the way that you can dynamically build around different abilities in the game is an interesting addition. Even your base abilities like dash and block can gain some warping upgrades that either suit your preferred strategy or allow you to more effectively navigate a challenging sequence. You can not equip all upgrades at once, rather you&rsquo;ll have to slot them into a grid with some tetris-like positioning. This will have you continuously shifting your setup to test new abilities, try out new synergies, or get an extra boost for a level that gives you some trouble.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Ghostrunner shines most when you can enter the flow state &mdash; where you almost thoughtlessly glide around the level and every next move feels natural. This enhances the feeling of being a swift and skilled mercenary while the mechanical precision required to deliver on that fantasy remains fulfilling. At its core, the game is all about the satisfaction of execution, so moments that break the flow or leave you feeling more frustrated than satisfied are what hurt the experience most. Unintentional wall climbs, bouncing off surfaces and getting stuck in a wall run are some examples where the movement feels clunkier than you&rsquo;d want and can restrict the flow that you strive to achieve. These aren&rsquo;t the biggest issues by themselves but can definitely feel frustrating, though they are most exacerbated by this next pain point.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The mechanics and feel of the game are overall certainly strong enough to facilitate an engaging and satisfying journey, so the remaining crucial component comes down to level design. This is where certain moments throughout the game can fall apart: each time you have to circumnavigate an enemy or turn around to retrace your steps yields another instance of breaking the flow. This doesn&rsquo;t always occur, but the frequency of these moments is certainly higher than I&rsquo;d like. Part of this issue I believe stems from the fact that the levels are designed to be quite open in the sense that there isn&rsquo;t a clear route you must take in order to progress. With that being said, however, there certainly is a more optimal route to take that makes the timing of enemy movement and placement of obstacles the least cumbersome to deal with. This openness provides the illusion of freedom, though in most cases going off the beaten path will just send you back to the last checkpoint.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >A very specific instance of this can be seen in one of the earlier levels &ldquo;The Climb&rdquo;; some quick context is that this is a combat section that starts out with a series of wall runs, and each wall run in Ghosturnner gives you an increase in altitude. For this segment, you have to break two objects between wall runs, but if you were to attempt them consecutively you would be too high up to break the second. This small instance, assuming it doesn&rsquo;t result in a death, will have you clumsily circling the main stage in order to get back to that object, all while the enemies are attacking you. If the position of that second object was just a bit higher, you would be able to slice them both in one consistent run and continue from there. These are the breaking moments that add up throughout each level and can make the experience less enjoyable. A more forced, or at least more obvious path that has the player go in a certain direction would help facilitate a cleaner line that is still satisfying to complete.</span></p>

            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >Ghostunner&rsquo;s music brings in dark synthwave which perfectly sets the tone for the game. Expect heavy distortion and a strong bass to provide a strong momentum throughout each piece as fluttering retro style synths keep things interesting. Combine that with the slight industrial nature of cyberpunk music and you&rsquo;ve got a super strong soundtrack that will keep you slicing and dicing. The opening cutscene of the game gives you a taste into what awaits you by teasing two other songs from the OST: &ldquo;Vendetta&rdquo; from the level &lsquo;Faster&rsquo; and &ldquo;The Orb&rdquo; from the final boss fight. More on that later.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The menu theme &ldquo;Air&rdquo; is an excellent greeting that gives you a strong sample of what this soundtrack has in store. While a bit lower tempo than other pieces you&rsquo;ll hear throughout the game, the lack of intensity is apt for browsing the menu options before kicking into high gear. We start out with airy synths playing an ostinato pattern to evoke some mysteriousness, interrupted by some heavy handed, crunchy synths that firmly darken the mood. Background harmony accents join in as another hollow, reverbing synth doubles this pattern. At 0:56 we get the percussion to join us on the drop for momentum along with a muddy bass synth. The lighter synths from before still play their repeated pattern while occasional guitar like strums accent the end of a phrase. 1:32 switches things up again as we get a syncopated synth pattern typical of the genre which takes the driving role in the stead of percussion. A solid foray into dark synthwave with plenty of hints as to what you can expect to hear as you delve deeper into the world of Ghostrunner.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >&ldquo;Striker&rdquo; opens up with fluttering synths popping in and out across the left and right stereos. The instrumentation gets darker as the song materializes and finds its groove with a simple percussion pattern. 1:09 gets us into full gear when a cascading synth takes the lead while background synths build hazy chords to a crescendo in the background. Suddenly all the instruments drop out for a typical deep electro bass breakdown before percussion comes back in to establish a house synth beat. These tracks evolve so nicely as you progress throughout each level, with the changes of instrumentation adding a new texture to each section that you navigate.</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >&ldquo;Solitude&rdquo; has the rare property to actually sound uplifting in an otherwise pretty mechanical soundtrack. Not mechanical as in boring mind you, but one that emphasizes the robotic takeover that has slowly infected the city once Mara took over. A light and bouncy synth floats above a distorted and slightly funky deep synth. The energy of this track is a nice change of pace as you get introduced to the first fully autonomous enemies in the game, naming the name even more fitting.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Ghostrunner takes a brief interlude into more elements of horror in the level &lsquo;Reign from Hell&rsquo; and the track &ldquo;Razor&rdquo; meets that criteria in stride. This song sounds absolutely sinister right out the gate with the synth playing an unresolved ostinato in a minor key, a heavily distorted bass, and harmony chords reminiscent of a funeral dirge. As the song progresses, we gradually lose the feel of the melody as the crunchy synths haphazardly take over the song and give it a glitch-like feeling. This pairs amazingly well with the hectic bomber cyborgs that crawl towards you at crazy speed with one goal &mdash; to take you down with them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The first song spliced into the opening &ldquo;Vendetta&rdquo; starts as you finally meet Hel, who is meant to be the replacement for your kind. The simple, repeated phrase throughout the piece evokes a competitive urge as you see your counterpart race ahead of you. The nonstop motion throughout this piece serves only to catalyze your natural instincts as you forge a path of destruction ahead in order to show why you&rsquo;re not leaving anytime soon.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The opening then transitions into the hulking yet speedy final boss theme, &ldquo;The Orb&rdquo;. What more fitting way to follow up an encounter with Mara&rsquo;s creation than the Keymaster herself. This song is filled with urgency as the clean percussion and deep bass synth lunge forwards. This track has all the intensity you want for a final encounter and leaves plenty of room for you to focus on the gameplay; all of the lighter synths and supporting instruments are dropped out for this track to leave you with raw determination to end the fight once and for all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Forget the Past&rdquo; will remind you most of the menu theme in its slowed down, more reflective composition which fits a credits theme quite well. A driving bassline is still present to keep us moving forward, but sparsely played synths reverberate a relatively hollow soundscape to give us room to breathe and think about what has transpired. While not jubilant, the track sets the scene that while our job is done, there is plenty more to do in order to restore the city from its ruins. A fitting end for our character and this game to return to the &lsquo;Cybervoid&rsquo; sound from which we came.</span></p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >There are a few more specific areas where I felt the flow break down as discussed in the pain points section. A quick prefix though, playing this game immediately after Neon White is tough with how high the bar was set. Neon White has airtight levels that feel phenomenal to tear through, and this game strives for a similar feeling but with many more moving parts to nail. Neon White abstracts nearly everything away from the levels that isn&rsquo;t pure platforming (shooting is a means to an end, not the main focus) while Ghostrunner goes for a more complete world which requires a higher level of polish in order for the combat and platforming to both hold up. Okay enough of a caveat, let&rsquo;s talk details.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >First off is the shield enemy: even in their introductory level I found the process to defeat them to be quite cumbersome. As I got better at dealing with them throughout the game though, I still felt that they were an inelegant and unnecessary quagmire amongst the usual streamlined gameplay. Second and probably my least favorite is the first boss fight &ldquo;The Gatekeeper&ldquo; during phase one. The timed nature of the lasers effectively means that you have to attempt many awkward pauses and jumps instead of cruising up the level. Eventually you&rsquo;ll find that you can nearly grapple up the entire section without even touching a platform, but this is extremely unintuitive and an unlikely route to be found in a first playthrough. This results in a frustrating but also slow encounter which at least gets a more enjoyable phase two and three. Finally, there is a bit of this in &ldquo;Reign from Hell&rdquo; which has the bomber zombie enemies. The lack of clarity around what the detonation range of these enemies is makes this level become more of a guessing game than I would prefer. Spamming your fastest movement abilities in hopes that everything works out is not great for satisfying and mastery-fulfilling gameplay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Overall I would prefer more of a focus on streamlined parkour and fast kills as you sweep across the level. However, going the other direction towards isolated combat sequences could certainly also be compelling; when they are designed elegantly they absolutely provide immense levels of satisfaction upon. The movement systems are so well done though that I think having a larger focus on that part of the game with enemies interspersed would lead to more seamless sections where you can enjoy playing with the mechanical limits of the game. When the levels in Ghostrunner find their stride, it is nothing short of remarkable. The clean and precise execution makes your character immensely satisfying to pilot when all the pieces inevitably do line up though.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >One of the earlier ability upgrades you&rsquo;ll acquire modifies your deflect skill to also reflect projectiles. This added form of defense turned to offense is extremely fun and certainly adds to the dynamics of the game. Wall running while deflecting bullets to kill an enemy before jumping off the wall to finish off the last enemy is simply too cool to ignore and quickly became a core facet of the game for me. Full maxing out the deflect upgrades will transform you into more of a timing based spellcaster, where each reflection puts you into sensory boosts and helps refill your focus meter to cast more special abilities.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As for the special abilities that you unlock throughout Ghostrunner; Blink, Tempest, and Surge all provide you with powerful long range attacks. When fully equipping all upgrades for one of these powers, you&rsquo;ll be able to reset their cooldown briefly for multiple uses or an instant focus refresh. This yields a novel way of approaching the level design by incentivizing you to find lines that allow you to dispatch multiple enemies in one chained combo by finding unique angles or quickly platforming between far sections. Taking this ability based approach to the game I&rsquo;d say covers a lot of the weaknesses that I discussed earlier. If there&rsquo;s a specific enemy or combat setup that just isn&rsquo;t working for you, rotate some upgrades in and blast your way through that section. The abilities are visceral and provide a smooth escalation to your powers as you slowly rediscover yourself and what you wish to fight for.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >From a story perspective there isn&rsquo;t anything too crazy going on, a fairly expected setup in cyberpunk begins to develop where you discover that your maker, or those responsible for your cybernetic enhancements, may not be your best friend. Working through the campaign as the Architect coldly guides your restoration and Zoe provides emotional context and weight to the past years is reasonably engaging. As you realize that the Architect seems tunneled on revenge and regaining his own power when compared to the Climbers and Zoe only seeking to allow civilization to be free again, you&rsquo;ll reach the end of the game in full alignment to the final actions taken by the player character. The final cybervoid sequence is certainly the most thrilling of the set and culminates cleanly with a final goodbye to the Architect; satisfying for sure.</span></p>

                <p><span >Ghostrunner is a solid first person platformer where the execution on the cyberpunk theme is brilliantly done. Even though it doesn&rsquo;t have the most polish, there is plenty of room to enjoy satisfying movement as you cut through swathes of enemies in clinical fashion. Dodging instant kills and returning the favor will give you plenty of enjoyment amongst parkouring through this futuristic world that sports an industrial synthwave soundtrack.</span></p>
