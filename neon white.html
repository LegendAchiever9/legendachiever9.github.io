                <p><span >Take the role of an assassin brought to heaven in order to exterminate a demon infestation in this high octane platformer where you&rsquo;ll shoot your way through tight platforming levels at breakneck pace. Collect weapon cards with unique discard effects to jump, dash, and blast through levels and aim to get the fastest time all while listening to some intense drum and bass.</span></p>

                <p><span >Aside from being an FPS platformer, the main mechanic of Neon White takes the form of cards that you&rsquo;ll pick up throughout each level. Each card shows a weapon, ranging from a high fire rate machine gun to a close range shotgun. To make it a bit more interesting however, each card has a unique discard effect: some allow you to double jump while some allow you to fire a grappling hook. This simple change already enables the developers to make the levels extremely dynamic, requiring you to quickly pick up and discard each weapon to help traverse the map.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >Before you can complete a level you&rsquo;ll have to defeat a fixed amount of demons that have various abilities and attack patterns. Weaving in your own shots between running, dodging, and using your discard movement abilities is the name of the game as you try to outmaneuver the level and its enemies as fast as you can. Speed is indeed the name of the game as upon finishing a level you&rsquo;ll receive a medal based on your time ranging from bronze to &ldquo;ace&rdquo;. Chasing the ace medal for each level was already more than enough of an incentive for me especially considering just how precisely constructed the game is. Almost every single level has a brilliantly smooth and satisfying path to complete at a speed that will earn you an ace medal. Across my entire time spent in the game I can only think of 1 or </span><em><span >maybe </span></em><span >2 out of </span><em><span >nearly 100</span></em><span > missions that didn&rsquo;t feel crisp enough to glide all the way through &mdash; this game is a true masterpiece when it comes to mechanical satisfaction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Some levels are definitely more difficult than others in execution, but also in the obscurity of the optimal path for your speedrun. As a counterbalance to this, each incremental medal you earn fills your insight meter: not only will this progress the metagame quests, but will also provide hints towards a feasible path that gets you ever so closer to the coveted ace medal. The game actually helps you learn how to speedrun it while you play, which is a delightfully clever and effective technique that lets you keep your momentum up. It&rsquo;s always nice to have insight as a fallback If you fail to see the shortcut angles yourself, but a core enjoyment for my playthrough was absolutely rooted in figuring out how to get the best time I could in each level.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I didn&rsquo;t come for the story but the concept is certainly interesting and where the story progresses in a way that is engaging to follow through to the end. Paired with the main story is a relationship builder where you&rsquo;ll use your gained insight to learn more about the characters from your past life that you no longer remember. This gradual reveal of the full backstory of the game is solid and a pretty good way of getting to know the characters more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Getting to know the cast better is also the distribution mechanism for sidequest levels that you&rsquo;ll unlock throughout your adventure. In general, I found the main levels to be much more compelling than these add-ons, with an exception for the jigsaw-inspired Violet levels which really change the way you approach the game. This was an interesting switch-up that really honed into the puzzle aspect of the game, with traps and contraptions reminiscent of rage platformers (though executed in a way that doesn&rsquo;t feel unfair).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I say all of this about the metagame as long as you can bear through the writing which I&rsquo;ll discuss as my only pain point below.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
               <p><span >It&rsquo;s crazy that this game is built for speedrunning so much so that you can even skip the dialogue. Seriously, the writing in this game is absolutely not for me (no really, I hate it) &mdash; from what I can tell it is styled after anime tropes to the extreme which when combined with the voice acting was pretty offputting for me. Fortunately, the fast forward feature allowed me to follow the actual plot without having to listen to most of the overexaggerated conversations. I can certainly see this to be enjoyable for some people and I&rsquo;m happy for you, but I&rsquo;ll stick to the gameplay.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The OST is pure Drum and Bass mixed with Breakcore like there&rsquo;s no tomorrow; this game is like walking into a 90s rave (don&rsquo;t ask if I&rsquo;ve been to one). This entails a lightning fast drum beat alongside strong bass lines. Mix that in with reverb heavy audio samples and synthesizers galore and you&rsquo;ve got a real jungle type beat going. Quick disclaimer, drum and bass is a bit heavy for me usually, so the softer elements of the genre work better for me and this I&rsquo;ll cover more of those. Fear not if you&rsquo;re into the more hardcore pieces, there is plenty in this soundtrack for you so go give it a listen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Glass Ocean&rdquo; is such a great choice to kick off the game as the theme used for all of Chapter 1. The opening figure is on such a cheery, open synth that gives you so much room to breathe. This matches the open layout of the early levels and the sampled &lsquo;aim for the heavens&rsquo; really sets the tone for the journey ahead. At 0:58 you&rsquo;ll hear a fast paced bridge to get you ready for the beat switch later; lots of layered synth patterns at quick subdivisions (16th and 32nd notes) give the tune a rushed feeling. 1:50 brings in a new lead synth that slides up and down the melody while a hollow bell sound pattern makes up our lighter bass until we get back to the original pattern and loop. The simplicity and upbeat nature of this song along with being a great tonesetter for the game cements this track as my song of the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Chapter 4 features the song &ldquo;Sin to Win&rdquo; which opens with a crazy synth organ lineup that lets you know something sinister is going on. There is a heavy use of dissonance and sharp sounding synths throughout the rest of this track which pairs well with the twisted nature of the Old City that you&rsquo;ve been forced to spelunk through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >You&rsquo;ll certainly not forget &ldquo;Cloud Nine&rdquo; as the Chapter 5 theme with the voice samples echoing throughout the intro. This piece takes a more laid back melody with calmer, peaceful synths playing longer figures while floating above our standard drum and bass patterns beneath. 1:55 brings us into a section that is in two which also contributes to the lazier feeling as more &lsquo;cloud nine&rsquo; audio clips elevate this feeling of loftiness.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Fight or Flight&rdquo; is our Chapter 7 theme which kicks off with a bizarre intro. The real rhythm comes in at 0:34 with a lead synth evocative of Chapter 1. This leads us into a glitchy drum break where the bass is heavily featured. After one loop we add in a muted, watery synth which fits perfectly into the Hanging Gardens aesthetic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The Chapter 8 theme is the funky &ldquo;House of Cards&rdquo; with a dance inducing bass line in the intro. Our lead synth joins at 0:52 with an airy and uplifting sound; this funky bass and light melody combination fit perfectly into our neo-cyberpunk cityscape found throughout the Chapter. 1:17 gives us a quick bridge and vocal sample before kicking off into the main groove of the song. This beat is so jolly and fun I can&rsquo;t help but draw a parallel to Fall Guys: both of these dance breaks absolutely pass the vibe check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Moving on to some of the tracks not from the main missions, &ldquo;Solitary Grace&rdquo; plays during Red&rsquo;s sidequests. At 1:25 the drum and bass drops out to make room for a warm sounding, ringy synth. This really lets the new groovy bass find a home on top of the sustained chords. Then we add in some disc scratches and bells for the bridge before we ramp back up into full swing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Rigged Game&rdquo; is anything but peaceful as you navigate deathtraps in Violet&rsquo;s sidequests. At 0:29 the repeated bassline leaves while a lone high pitched synth takes over with a grungy bass. At 0:50 electric guitar sounding synth gets the spotlight along with a harmony in another synth and the bass. This piece is coordinated but hectic feeling and fits the calculated psycho nature of these levels.</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >&ldquo;Heavenly Delight&rdquo; is the theme for the more playful and fun cutscenes that take place during the metagame. To match we get lighthearted, hyperpop style vocal chops and synths to bring up the mood. A very classic drumline keeps things moving but doesn&rsquo;t make you feel stressed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >&ldquo;Stained Glass&rdquo; cannot be further from any other track throughout the game and is only played during the more serious memory sequences. This is a purely atmospheric track with no melody and no drums. A synth ostinato carries for most of the track while high strings hold sustained notes over top. A plucky synth floats intermittently amongst the calm and a&nbsp; deep, reverbing bass crescendos throughout the entire song. Slowly but surely instruments start to drop out as we fade the volume to resolve this introspective track that will surely give you some pause amongst the go-go-go of the rest of the game.</span></p>

                    <p><span >Aside from events in the story there really isn&rsquo;t much to include here. One thing would be the bossfight levels, which were actually unexpected for a game like this. Instead of a traditional bossfight these sparingly used levels still maintain the same speedrun style feel, just with one central target that moves throughout the level with you instead of the prepopulated demon spawns.These encounters felt just different enough to be interesting while still keeping the same rhythm of the game that works so well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >In a game about being a condemned assassin recruited to kill demons in heaven, having the main theme center around redemption and forgiveness isn&rsquo;t the most expected result. Your history with the cast from your past life gets slowly revealed up until the final moments where you learn that you are the reason the whole team died. Maybe not you directly, but your lack of ability to stand up to Green in pursuit of some greater goal that wasn&rsquo;t worth it. The game then culminates with a final showdown against Green at the bottom of heaven. Once you emerge victorious and all the cards are in your hand, you&rsquo;re faced with one final choice: condemn Green and subject yourself to another cycle of judgement and retribution, or forgive all that is past and bring yourself and your former team into a new life. Nothing groundbreaking but a solid background to the killer gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Upon completing the game you&rsquo;ll unlock the Rush modes which task you with running through all levels or color respective sidequests consecutively. These challenges definitely fit the speedrunning spirit of the game and can be a fun way to revisit the game or test your mettle. Mikey&rsquo;s Rush is most notable in that it is an exact copy of White&rsquo;s in that you&rsquo;ll have to complete every main mission consecutively, but the catch is that every single card is replaced with &ldquo;Dominion&rdquo;: also known as the rocket launcher with a grappling hook on discard. This incredibly powerful card changes how you approach almost every level, allowing you to get quite creative with your pathing while getting some absolutely speedy times.</span></p>
