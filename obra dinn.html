                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >The transport vessel &ldquo;Obra Dinn&rdquo; carrying 60 crew members and passengers made its final voyage from London in 1802. The ship was declared lost and eventually drifted to shore with no survivors aboard. As the resident insurance inspector, it is up to you to figure out what happened! Correctly identify each individual and note their cause of death in this one of a kind time-defying mystery.</span></p>
            </section>

                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >The first thing that will immediately jump out at you is the art style of this game. Reminiscent of Papers, Please by the same developer, the visuals follow a rendering technique called dithering. Essentially applying noise to randomize the quantization error of the image; what this means in practice is that only 2 colors are used for the entire image, but you&rsquo;re tricked into seeing an illusion of depth and variety of color. This is done incredibly well throughout the game, depicting every scene in a way that you&rsquo;ll never forget.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As for the gameplay, it&rsquo;s essentially a walking simulator. Walk around the ship and investigate what happened to the passengers and crew on board by using your pocketwatch to travel back to the moment of death. You&rsquo;ll go around a still slice of time and piece together what was happening and who was involved. Sometimes the lead up to the scene will just be audio: an argument, a conversation, sputtering sounds, or broken glass. You&rsquo;ll learn to use the voices you hear as an aide in your quest. A sword flying through the air, boxes falling down from the cargo hold, a man rope-swinging through the air, a rowboat wobbling over choppy water; the game is filled with visceral moments that will properly immerse you into an 1800s sea voyage gone awry. Mark findings in your logbook by matching the picture of a person to: their name, cause of death, and killer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Whenever you have 3 fates correctly entered, the game will immediately validate your choice and lock them in (with a great tune to boot). As you may guess, you </span><em><span >can</span></em><span > use this feature to guess and check your way through this game. Be warned however, this is a </span><strong>knowledge-based game</strong><span > and as such you can only truly ever play this game one time. Even if you find yourself stuck, I would highly recommend taking a break or finding some friends to try and solve the mysteries with you. That being said, there are some fates that are orders of magnitude tougher than others and if you&rsquo;d like to use the validation strategy that&rsquo;s totally fair &mdash; it&rsquo;s in the game for a reason.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The story is unique and interesting as it tells a tale of greed bred by human nature. You&rsquo;ll find yourself not only piecing together the fate of those who were on the ship, but how and why the events unfolded as they did. This creates an extraordinarily tight and compelling gameplay loop that will have you looking from head to toe and bow to stern for every clue possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >We&rsquo;ll get to the music soon, but before that the sound design is immaculate. From the voice acting to the foley sound, everything is impactful and evocative: This foundation really lets your imagination fill in the surrounding elements of the picture to create a cohesive picture.</span></p>

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Honestly there isn&rsquo;t much to say here, the game is stellar. It is a puzzle game, however and as a result sometimes you will get stuck because you haven&rsquo;t noticed something. Playing alongside a friend can really help to alleviate this issue and is why I recommend that many puzzle games, especially of this nature, are best played cooperatively. I&rsquo;ll cover the main point of frustration that comes from a specific puzzle after the point of no return below.</span></p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >It&rsquo;s so good, wow; the soundtrack takes the already impeccable sound design and takes that straight into the music. You get the nostalgic and longing presence of a vintage cargo vessel from the harpsichord, wailing wind instruments, the organ, and the lone violin (which is the only live recorded instrument in this soundtrack!). Horns and marching drums give a sense of grandeur and intensity; rapidly moving string lines, bellowing horns and low winds give you the feelings of adventure and playfulness. These pieces are precisely paired with specific scenes throughout the game and it all works together beautifully.</span></p>

                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >The soundtrack is so good and really elevates the experience of this game by setting the perfect mood for each chapter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Bitter Cold&rdquo; has the bouncy oompah sound which gives an air of lightheartedness to the scene. Quite fitting for the moments of peace and joy that the crew goes through before calamity ensues. The low strings keep the groove while a dulcet bassoon floats on top with a beautiful solo. Life at sea may not be so bad at all. The addition of the horns in Part B of this track are a great evolution that adds more scale to this endeavour and introduces the risk of death present on this voyage. You probably heard this song way too many times due to the wealth of necessary information stored in this scene. Still great music though.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Murder&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t appear to do much with the sparse notes and marching drum, but when the strings come in with the supporting line the tension goes straight through the roof. Part B is where the magic happens though with the live recorded violin solo above a lone cello with its sustained notes below. Then the strings from Part A come back and help paint the picture of a true tragedy. The criminally unfair death of the vessel&rsquo;s lone musician caused by cowardice and avarice. He was a violinist though, which makes the instrumentation choice all the more brilliant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Unholy Captives&rdquo; is a straight up funeral march where we are introduced to the lethality of one of the main threats of the game, the crab riders. A marching drum and organ kick off this dirge followed by a haunting organ solo and a mournful synth that just screams tragedy, talk about a tone setter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Soldiers of the Sea&ldquo; is the fan favorite track for sure and it&rsquo;s easy to see why: a fast moving string line provides a sense of intrigue which is aptly followed up by the tubular bells. They are so incredibly effective at setting the scene of something otherworldly. This happens in parallel to the in-game experience of revealing these monstrosities through the hull windows of the ship as you wonder what on earth is going on; a truly unforgettable moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Doom&ldquo; is just a brutally intense track, hands down. And what better time to use it than the literal kraken attack of the boat. This is mostly done through some punchy horns and strings playing repeated long notes and some excellent chord progressions. A colossal scale and aggressive tone are fitting sounds for this moment.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Main Theme&ldquo; is a bit of a cheeky choice for song of the game since it encompasses some of the other chapter themes within it. Nevertheless it is my choice due to the absolutely majestic scene it paints for what is to come. Fast moving strings, an oompah bassline, violin solo, and the bells are back. Featuring an excerpt from &ldquo;Soldiers of the Sea&rdquo; also helps cement this tune as amazing.</span></p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >Most of the deductions in the game are brilliant and are extremely satisfying to complete. I wouldn&rsquo;t say any of them are too tough or unreasonable aside from a few exceptions: Zungi Sathi was </span><em><span >not</span></em><span > spiked by a beast. Now don&rsquo;t get it twisted, he </span><em><span >was </span></em><span >stabbed by a beast but not fatally, the killing blow was an accidental shot from the Bosun's Mate. This is a premium misdirection and quite a hard one to spot. It&rsquo;s easy to assume (as I did) that he just bled out, but you can see the bullet trail if you peep through the window and the hole in the wall is actually still visible in the present day.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The hammock numbers are a great way to show the level of detail that you are expected to use in your investigations. Hopping into different memories and noting which people are awake, which hammocks are still up, and special items next to hammocks end up being satisfying deductions to make and allow you to feel rewarded for your attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Now a level of detail that I </span><em><span >don&rsquo;t </span></em><span >think the game accurately equips you for is the shoe situation for the Chinese topman. Relying on knowledge of voices, accents, and appearances are all totally fine and work really well for the game. However, I was definitely not expecting to need to pay attention to the shoes of a specific character to find out their identity. These are likely the last fates you&rsquo;ll need to uncover and can definitely be a bit frustrating. No shame in using validation for these, but well done if you&rsquo;re able to spot this detail. The eventual realization that I had upon finally noticing this after many repeated visits to &ldquo;A Bitter Cold&rdquo; was staggering, frustrating, but above all else still cool.</span></p>
