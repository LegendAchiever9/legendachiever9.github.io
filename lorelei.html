                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Explore the seemingly abandoned Hotel Letztes Jahr in this surreal puzzle game that directs its focus towards experimental storytelling and viscerally satisfying puzzle design. A film noir aesthetic with accents of color serve as the stage to a performance where you&rsquo;ll be forced to reckon with your perception of time, identity, and memory as you unravel a narrative that is deeply connected with each clue you uncover.</span></p>

                <p><span >To get it out of the way, I tagged this game as atmospheric horror mostly to address the ambience and themes that this game tackles. Just a brief warning that the story is quite dark, though it is veiled beneath several layers of abstraction from gameplay and the interwoven presentation of the story. Other than the subject matter itself, the art style also lends itself to the more unsettling side of things using a monochrome aesthetic with frequent splashes of red. The music makes frequent use of dissonance to keep players on edge and while the gameplay is mostly walking around and solving puzzles, there are certainly sequences that may leave you feeling uneasy, though likely not frightened.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As I mentioned above the art style will immediately stand out as the majority of the game is entirely in black and white. This is certainly not the only noir focused aspect of the game &mdash; as the music and dialogue both follow this trend &mdash; but one that is the most evident, especially when contrasted with the occasional bouts of red that come up through different parts of the game. Furthermore, this color palette is also emphasized when the visual fidelity of the game changes to a more pixelated view depending on certain developments in the story.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Speaking of the story, it is certainly artsy &mdash; interesting and thought provoking, yet confusing. You probably won&rsquo;t wrap your head around it on the first playthrough&nbsp; and a lot of it is left up to interpretation. It is really hard to decipher what is real, what is allegorical, and what any true takeaways from this experience should be. The driving factor to this ambiguity is the presentation layer that obfuscates what &ldquo;really happened&rdquo; away from the player. You&rsquo;ll hear about the events of the plot in three different time periods and through three different mediums in the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As for the gameplay itself, the majority of the game consists of walking around the hotel grounds, reading documents, and solving the puzzles around you to unlock more of the manor. Traversing the game world feels quite similar to games like </span><em><span >Luigi&rsquo;s Mansion, Resident Evil 2, or The Sexy Brutale</span></em><span >; an interconnected manor where you need time to get your bearings and aim to access new parts of the building. This game on the other hand takes a relatively unique approach to the puzzle aspect, favoring the inclusion of many individually contained puzzles of different types that all share a common theme. The puzzles overall are quick to complete, clear as to when they are solvable, and satisfying to crack. There is a great balance between puzzles that can be solved quickly yet allow you to talk away satisfied in your competence, and those that spark a moment of discovery when you finally uncover the information needed to solve them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Generally every puzzle is quite self contained and does not require outside information to solve, with a few notable exceptions. While information not in your immediate view isn't necessary, the answers are all cut from the same cloth and it is this pseudo-omniscience granted to the player that allows you to solve many of the puzzles more quickly than you otherwise would. If you&rsquo;re familiar with the escape room adage to &ldquo;look for inputs&rdquo;, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes takes that to the extreme. If it sounds like I&rsquo;m dodging around what this centralizing theme is for answering the puzzles, that&rsquo;s because I am &mdash; we&rsquo;ll talk more in the spoiler section!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As for progression, the game opens up quite nonlinearly but you will eventually reach a point where your ability to move forwards is restricted by one piece of information you haven&rsquo;t found yet. On that note, I&rsquo;d highly recommend playing this game in a somewhat condensed time frame and as always, I believe puzzle games are best enjoyed with a friend. The complexity of the narrative, the highly interlocked nature of the puzzle theming, and your memory of the hotel&rsquo;s layout are all key factors that greatly benefit from not being forgotten due to an extended lapse in play sessions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >While most of the puzzles follow escape room style logic, if you forget &mdash; or haven&rsquo;t discovered &mdash; where the key (physical or otherwise) to a puzzle is, you will get quite stuck. The game has two systems built in to assist you in this manner: the mental notes section and documents list. The former is a notepad list of things that you have interacted with but haven&rsquo;t unlocked, whether that be a door, or something a bit more abstract. The latter is a repository of almost every piece of written media that you find throughout the game from movie posters to newspaper clippings. These two aide-m&eacute;moires are essentially for enabling a smooth experience throughout the game and prevent you from having to take copious pages of notes. The game hits an excellent stride when you&rsquo;re able to bounce around the hotel solving puzzle after puzzle while your brain digests the trail that the narrative has left for you. </span></p>

            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p>Related to the last point above, the only real pain point I have is the occasional moments where you can&rsquo;t find a specific piece of information needed to progress. The in-game map generally does a great job at preventing this state by highlighting areas you haven&rsquo;t been to, but some way to tie the mental notes to the map would have been the extra step needed to remove this problem entirely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other small issue I have with the game is the slightly repetitive nature of some segments of the game. By no means did this take away from my overall enjoyment, but having some sections of a walking simulator where you need to walk slower or more precisely were not the highlight moments of the game for me. I&rsquo;ll get into more specifics after the point of no return but I really don&rsquo;t have much negative to say here.</p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The main menu theme aptly named &ldquo;Titles&rdquo; starts out a bit strangely as a violin plays a high pitched note. Normally an orchestra will tune to the note A4 (440Hz) played by the concertmaster, or lead violin. In this track however, we hear the two octaves higher A6 (1760Hz) at the beginning as the standard tuning A4 comes in underneath. A synth ostinato fades into the mix as the driving force for this piece until 0:15 where our melody arrives: a hauntingly clean vocal doubled by a piano. At 0:32 the synth pattern dives down to a lower pitch and starts playing arpeggiated lines before settling back into the alternating note rhythm from before. This sequence happens twice with the vocal melody before two new instruments take over in the viola and cello at 0:53. The viola and doubled cello play the same main line and still have the synth background yet field a more melancholic and raw sound when compared to the vocals from earlier. The piano starts to creep back in at 1:30 where it is joined by the vocals as we play a new melody that is much happier in tone before looping back to the viola and cello doubled line from before. A perfect introductory piece that feels slow yet moves forward, one that inspires thought even with a single melodic line and bare instrumentation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The track &ldquo;Mind Game&rdquo; takes a page out of &ldquo;Resurrections&rdquo; from the game </span><em><span >Celeste </span></em><span >with the use of dissonance between a synth and piano &mdash; if you&rsquo;ve played that game you&rsquo;ll absolutely see the parallels to Lorelei from both a narrative and musical perspective. Eerie vocals, a slow moving electric piano, a theremin, and several different synthesizers set the tone to one that is both introspective and unsettling. The occasional interruption from a violin vibrato adds some texture to the track in the lower registers as the theremin sound wobbles above the melody to add to uneasy feeling. This track is one of your earliest indicators that things may not be as they seem in the world that you explore throughout the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Legend of Creation&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a long piece and it is one that only plays during a sequence of scrolling text where you learn about some of the world&rsquo;s history relevant to the story. The main aspect of this track I want to highlight is the way that the instrumentation builds and eventually releases tension. We start with a lonely synth pattern that will continue for the entire duration and a solo vocal with the melody. If you listen closely, we actually double the synth with another sort of plucked synth that crescendos as the piece progresses. Then we add one cello as our bassline though there are actually two cellos playing overall &mdash; the second playing in the middle register in a harmony with the lower one. At the same time we hear another higher voice to harmonize with long sustained notes in the upper octave, and an extremely faint synth floating above the rest of the music with a pitter patter sound. As the piece concludes, all of the instruments (notably all of the synthetic ones as well) drop out to leave just the upper vocal and both cellos to hold the last chord out as it fades away. Even though not much happens on screen as you simply read the text, the music sets up a journey to add color and emotion as you uncover more threads of the plot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Black Arts Coffee Club&rdquo; is the music you hear while on hold as you make a phone call to order an espresso. We start out with typical jazz scat singing, that is to say singing just on syllables like &ldquo;doo&rdquo; and &ldquo;dah&rdquo; as opposed to formal lyrics. This was popularized in the 1920&rsquo;s by Louis Armstrong and further taken into mainstream music by Ella Fitzgerald in the 1950&rsquo;s. After this introduction the instrumentation comes in with a strange synth playing very digital sounding notes in an escalating pattern mixed with a full jazz drum kit with brushes (instead of drum sticks) and a string bass. The groove that follows is a callback to jazz noir from the 1950s which matches ever so perfectly with the black and white television aesthetic of the game. At 0:43 the piano takes the lead with periodic strumming from an amp acoustic guitar that provides a unique sound to this classic style.</span></p>

                    <p><span >&ldquo;Interrogation&rdquo; plays when you are in the befragungsraum, or interrogation room as you may expect. We start out with some twangy, reverb guitar riffs accompanied by a walking bass. We fill in the instrumentation at 0:28 with a classic jazz drum kit alongside some piano pads. There isn&rsquo;t really a full melody line in this piece, instead the echoing piano notes doubled by an electric piano guide us through this track. The emptiness of the piece and repetitive nature reinforce the idea that we should be paying our full attention to our surroundings. These segments present a staged environment that you must dedicate to memory, as you will be asked one question once you leave about the state of what you saw: how many books were on the table or what was behind the candelabra, for example. The nature of this theme not only calls back to the crime and detective fiction films of the past with the darker jazz groove, but also in the gameplay as you literally inspect the scene as a private investigator would.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >There are two musical numbers for lack of a better term throughout the game where the usual text based exchanges are accompanied by a dedicated song. &ldquo;Laser Eyes&rdquo; is the first of these two which takes place after solving the piano puzzle, which has nothing to do with music unfortunately (though it makes sense given the desire to maintain generality in puzzles). Not only is this a musical sequence, we actually get a full blown song with lyrics sung by Lorelei; this is the only time we get a fully sung piece aside from credits. The lyric &ldquo;I am an old woman, I dream in black and white&rdquo; is quite literal when it comes to some information about the game&rsquo;s story and is helpful for wrapping your head around things but is easy to miss in the context of this moment. Okay as for the music itself, we start out with just a solo voice over the piano before 0:45 when the full mix comes to fruition. We have the main vocal echoed twice with different harmonies (one in each ear, actually!) alongside a cello and two violins playing long notes to complete the harmony. The climax of the song brings the piano out of the background with some higher octave chords to soar above the rest of the instrumentation before we gradually fade out with the last syllable sung over the strings as they decrescendo. This was a lovely moment that I was totally not expecting &mdash; I was sure that a piano track would play but this was special.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Our second musical number, &ldquo;Misdirection Bossa Nova&rdquo;, takes place after solving the music box puzzle and gives us a chance for some direct conversation with Renzo. Of course, he uses this opportunity to speak almost entirely in riddles and euphemisms, hence the name of this track. First off, the instrumentation for this piece is super unique: three electric guitars and two violins with two synthesizers joining in later. We start out with one guitar playing an ostinato figure while the melody is played by one violin and the other guitar, likely using spring reverb (as opposed to a digital amp) to achieve that old school sound. At 0:20 we add the third guitar and second violin for countermelodies, which gives the piece a much fuller sound. That fullness is pushed to the ceiling at 0:35 where we add in the synthesizers to play a moving eighth note line which creates a ton of slightly chaotic action. This quickly subsides at 0:50 though where we both violins and two guitars playing tutti, or in two lines. They all play the same rhythm with added harmony, bringing a stronger clarity and power to the piece. This unison remains throughout the second half of the track while the synthesizers continue to play a moving line underneath to drive the dance forwards. A combination of two disparate instruments and melodies eventually joining together, like two fated individuals finally coming back together after 51 years to let go of the past and look towards a better future. This was no romance though, as Renzo makes sure to let Lorelei know that he was not interested in women &mdash; instead, this is a fellow artist from memories past helping Lorelei move on from the nightmare she created in her own mind. For my american dollar, easy grab for song of the game here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Shockingly, &ldquo;How It Ends&rdquo; is the song that plays during the final cutscene of the game where we finally reach &ldquo;as close to the truth as we&rsquo;ll get&rdquo;. This moment is the big reveal where it is confirmed that we are indeed the ones that are responsible for the death of Renzo, and it is this moment where we allow ourselves to replay this memory that enables Lorelei to accept what has happened. The portrayal of this sequence is rather clever, where Renzo (being the film director that he was) directs us as an actor to walk through each action that led to the ultimate push. This conscious acknowledgement in Lorelei&rsquo;s mind, expressed as a recapitulation of Renzo&rsquo;s greatest film, while the script for &ldquo;The Third Eye&rdquo; scattered on the floor mirrors the entire scene is a lot to take in. As a result, a melancholic yet reflective piece is in order, which is exactly what we get. A somber piano in tempo rubato plays a solo line that is expressive enough for us to connect with it yet leaves enough space for us to focus on the dialogue and moment with Renzo. The strings lightly enter at 0:35 with supporting harmonies to show more feeling. At 1:20 and more clearly at 1:33 some low, hollow synths join in on the sustained chord. Again this piece has no true melody, it is the slow chord progression and lyrical voicing that gives the music life &mdash; even a slow pattern in the piano along with the ebb and flow of sustained chords is enough to give this scene what it needs to feel impactful.</span></p>

                    <p><span >This last pain point is a minor one and is generally around the game slowing you down your movement without enhancing the gameplay. The debug games have an incredibly slow walk speed and when paired with tank controls, can be a slog to get through. The quiz club camera change and shifting perspective along with the red maze shattering your screen into shards just made navigation more cumbersome without contributing to a more engaging experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >While the puzzle design in the game is quite varied in the type of challenge, there is a unifying sample space to the majority of puzzles that allows the player to hone in on a solution that otherwise would be unintuitive to reach. I am of course talking about what I&rsquo;ll call the three &ldquo;major years&rdquo; in Lorelei: 1847, 1963, and 2014. These are introduced early on in your adventure and are somewhat natural in their presence. In due time however, you&rsquo;ll notice that these are more than arbitrary years used for the narrative, and are rather the primary solution to most of the puzzles found throughout the hotel. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that the puzzles become trivial, but rather this idea unlocks a unique form of puzzle solving given this meta level knowledge that the player now has. The wine cellar puzzle is a perfect encapsulation of this concept. When presented with 20 wines that must be selected in order to reveal a secret passage, one would normally need to find some explanation that orders the wines in some way, which may or may end up being too straightforward and unsatisfying. In Lorelei however, given that we are assumed to understand the implicit relevance of these three years, finding wines on the hotel menu with vintage dates 1847, 1963, and 2014 immediately spell out a code that put the wind in my sails (or espresso in Lorelei&rsquo;s system) to run and complete this puzzle. It&rsquo;s such a simple idea but masterfully done throughout the game and enables some clever ideas that are engaging but never too estranged from your thought process to resolve.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Even with the answers generally being straightforward for what I&rsquo;ll call the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; puzzle type, the game keeps things fresh with several other flavors of puzzle: escape room checks, memory focused challenges, and game-spanning macro puzzles. The escape room style puzzles are generally self-contained and quick to solve if you see what they&rsquo;re getting at &mdash; the bolt shortcuts, document tubes, and minor year puzzle boxes are great examples of this. The memory focused challenges emphasize not solving a new quandary, but rather recalling what you&rsquo;ve experienced through the game so far, whether through the interrogation room sequences or the quiz club gauntlet And finally the macro puzzles are the minotaur eyes and logging into the OCU-3 supercomputer, both of which require an assembly of information from different parts of the game to complete. The variety that this brings to the game was a great way to keep the next puzzle interesting, as rarely did two consecutive puzzles require the same approach. Every bolt door was a rush of excitement as I flipped through the book to solve the next puzzle, meanwhile the minor year door perspective puzzles slowed the pace down to leave time for rumination.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Logging into the supercomputer OCU-3 was my favorite puzzle in the game and serves as the pinnacle challenge, requiring you to summon knowledge from each corner of the game: a username formed from the ripped posters from the very beginning of the game combined with the computer disc letters, a password formed from the spatial display in the mirror world, and a time period derived from geometric patterns that result from speaking the truth of each minor door to our future (technically current) self. An honorable mention absolutely goes to the quiz club &mdash; the high stakes question that you either solve in one shot, or get shot &mdash; which was a thrill to play through. Pouring over the documents you&rsquo;ve acquired throughout the game to find seemingly trite information seems daunting, yet the breadcrumbs were always there for our mind to follow and track down.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >While of course a major part of the gameplay, these major years are also the dominant story beats of the game: the first being the setting of the film &ldquo;The Third Eye&rdquo;, the second being the year of the incident, and the third and final year being the present. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, there are four central characters throughout the story with completely different (I wish it were so) names: Renzo, Lorelei, Lorenzo, and Renate. My coyness aside, the resemblance of these names is no coincidence, as &ldquo;The Third Eye&rdquo; film features fictional characters Lorenzo and Renate, though the events of this movie parallel what happened throughout our lives as Lorelei when fate intertwined us with Renzo Nero. To throw yet another wrench into this perplexing narrative, we have two extra sources of information that describe events that bear striking similarity to what we already know: the modern day police report of the incident in 1963 and religious texts from an expedition to a cave by an organization that both Lorelei and Renzo have allegedly been members of. While I won&rsquo;t dissect each story beat because that would take ages, I do want to discuss some of the potential themes that the story touches on, and welcome you to bring your own interpretations because after all, what else is art about?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The main theme of Lorelei centers around overcoming trauma and the road to recovery from PTSD, though the game does not handle these ideas in a traditional way. Being willing to remember your past, accept what has happened to you, and not think about what could have been are all key milestones on this journey. While they may look different for everyone, these are crucial steps that people need to tackle in their own way &mdash; in Lorelei, this manifests in the story when you finally sit through the memory of what happened between you and Renzo back in 1963. While simple on the surface, actually being able to sit through a traumatic memory and process the events that took place is a difficult endeavor, one for our character that took 51 years. This, followed by the final sequence that literally culminates in the questions "input=departed" and "input=responsible", are explicitly having Lorelei accept the fact that she killed Renzo. Even though she did not mean to kill him and that was even his intention, this finally enabled Lorelei to recompose herself in the present and move on. The one who helped her finally make this realization was none other than Renzo himself &mdash; in a strikingly realistic parallel, sometimes it is only the one tangled deepest in the wounds of your mind that can prevent future pain from reaching you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As an aside, the driving factor that led to Lorelei&rsquo;s trauma was Renzo pursuing a form of eternal art, one that depends on no spectator to be admired. The concept of someone&rsquo;s ultimate art taking the form of inflicted trauma that another person has to relive until they die is wildly dark and impactful. Even more so if you extend this idea to the notion that interactive media can capture those haunting memories and transmit them to others. This is a fascinating question that Lorelei postures to us as consumers as one side of a coin. The second side of which is the notion that art can inspire action amongst others &mdash; whether figuratively through media or literally as some divine presence, the very nature of artistic expression is inherently moving &mdash; whether the outcome of that movement is harmful or not is difficult to determine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >A third and final question I&rsquo;ll leave with you ties to the frequent parallels made throughout the game pitting art against capitalism. Does art exist solely for an audience or can it hold meaning on its own? If the latter is your belief, then perhaps we can understand the path taken by those who visited Sulawesi Cave: &ldquo;to blind yourself is to make there be one less pair of greedy eyes in the world.&rdquo; An effort, futile as it may be, to demonstrate that art does not exist to serve a particular viewer. The purest form of art breathes ad infinitum, with no requirement of a dedicated observer to justify its existence.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <p><span >Lorelei and the Laser Eyes will have you explore a mysterious hotel filled with interconnected rooms, fragmented memories, and cleverly designed puzzles that center around the game&rsquo;s narrative. A stylized world in black and white with dissonant music and nonlinear storytelling cultivate an unsettling yet highly rewarding experience. With puzzles inspired by escape room concepts and storytelling techniques akin to metafictional thrillers, the game rewards attention to detail while its narrative explores some pretty heavy topics that are very much open to interpretation.</span></p>
