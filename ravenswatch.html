                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >Characters from folklore around the world come together to battle an eldritch threat: little red riding hood becomes a shapeshifting assassin while the pied piper and his legion of rats play as a twin stick shooting bard. Ravenswatch is a roguelite dungeon crawler where you&rsquo;ll level up your abilities and acquire as much loot as you can before the master nightmare spawns when time runs out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
            </section>

                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >First off I think theming is so clever, taking characters from various fairy tales across the globe is compelling and leads to extremely unique designs. Even on your first playthrough where you don&rsquo;t know the characters, you&rsquo;ll have an innate understanding of their general vibe and see how the abilities mesh within that. The biggest exception is probably Scarlet who takes the role of little red riding hood; while the original character design has no mystical powers, the creative liberties that Ravenswatch takes brings her to an entertaining and well executed design. Going from a stealthy rogue with smoke bombs during the daytime to a hulking werewolf who heals from their attacks provides a twist on her storybook character in a way that fits well with the core gameplay.&nbsp; Every character has five abilities to play with in addition to a dash, and how you build each run will determine which of these abilities you index into as the core of your strategy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As with many diablo-likes, you&rsquo;ve got an isometric camera perspective with gameplay that focuses on dungeon exploration, cutting through large swathes of enemies, randomized loot, and establishing your character build. Each stage has three day-night cycles for you to clear the map and grow your power before transporting you to fight the master nightmare of that stage. This provides an extra layer of challenge to the typical ARPG formula by encouraging you to plan a route that allows you to most effectively get through as much of the level as possible. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll need to improvise and make quick decisions if you&rsquo;re running low on time: do you try and clear one more area to open a chest or do you go back to the shop and spend your gold before the bossfight. This added pressure ups the ante in an engaging manner that challenges you and makes each run feel different.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The levels are composed of &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; which can vary in type and difficulty, going from green to yellow to red as the amount and tier of enemies increases. There are a decent amount of different nodes though they mostly center around combat; the differences arise in the reward you get for each one. A chest containing a new magical object for your build, a raven totem that will reveal part of the map, or a fountain that raises your maximum health, there are plenty of objectives that will inform your approach to each run. Like other loot based games, magical objects range from common to legendary but there are two components to the system that are more unique: stacking enough of the same object can unlock very powerful set bonuses and the presence of cursed objects. The former introduces a chase element to your build, where reaching the set bonus can bring you to a higher cap. The latter are powerful objects with a drawback, some of which can be a big game changer to enable your strategy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Each node in addition to enemies you slay will provide experience that will allow your character to learn new talents, which modify or upgrade one of your five basic abilities. These talents combined with the magical objects that you&rsquo;ll acquire throughout each level are what make up your build for that run. Maybe you turn Scarlet into an incendiary throwing burst character or into a ravenous beast that can stay transformed for a longer period of time. Or perhaps the next run you focus around building up combo points to unleash a devastating backstab from stealth. The talents that you select each run make you more powerful but require you to find a playstyle that works around those talents. Each character has solid&nbsp; build diversity (at least on most of the difficulty levels) where you can choose an ability to try out and it will be reasonably viable.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The art style is most similar to Hades with black shadows being used for highlighting the character models. The environments are also nicely done when you have a chance to look at them amidst the chaos.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The game is definitely fun single-player, but multiplayer introduces an exciting extra dimension to the game where you can focus on synergies and combos. The elevated enemy scaling will also challenge your teamwork and demand you to put some effort towards planning out each encounter.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >There are four difficulty levels that you can select before each run and the span of these is quite broad. The first two are quite easy while the fourth is extremely challenging. Each level increases the strength of enemies, lowers the amount of revives you have, and most notably lowers the experience gain. I&rsquo;m personally not a huge fan of this lever as strictly decreasing the power of the player as opposed to increasing the external challenge is much less engaging. The third difficulty level is around the sweet spot for my taste where you can&rsquo;t autopilot but you don&rsquo;t have to fully focus all of your energy on executing each encounter with enemies. A result of this is an inverted difficulty curve where the early game is slow and harsh, while the endgame topples over in an instant if you&rsquo;ve made it there.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The other two smaller drawbacks here are on the mechanical side and can be a bit frustrating. A few characters have abilities that lock you into an animation which can lead to instant death if you use them right before an enemy happens to queue up an attack. Also there are some large AOE attacks that you cannot use invulnerability to dodge, you have to physically be outside of the space. This isn&rsquo;t very intuitive and can feel pretty bad if you just used your mobility spell, save your invulnerability, but can&rsquo;t use it if an AOE attack is incoming.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >At the end of the day, if you can accept the fact that the early game can sometimes just end your run and adapt to the control quirks, you&rsquo;ll still find a ton of enjoyment throughout the game. Multiplayer scaling will also test your coordination and require your team to work well together to overcome the first stage hurdles.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Music -->
            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The first point of intrigue you'll notice in this soundtrack is the instrumentation, as there are heavy folk influences and traditional instruments used throughout. There is such a wide variety of unique instruments here, let's list them all out, some of which even represent different characters' presence in the game. There&rsquo;s the tin whistle (which of course relates to the Pied Piper), vocals (which mimic the song of Melusine), bagpipes (both Scottish and Swedish), violin, cello, nyckelharpa (a keyed fiddle from Sweden), Algerian mandola (like mandolin is to a violin, but for a cello), as well as plenty of drums and percussion that help us move forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The other element that should jump out at you is the way that a folklore and tavern-style vibe emerges from the music. Of course a large part of this comes from the instrumentation, but a major factor is also the scales used in many of the pieces. A large portion of the soundtrack is written in harmonic minor keys, (sometimes with a raised 4th) which can combine to yield music that feels rustic, adventurous, and a bit dark.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another strong contribution to the feel of this whole soundtrack comes from the melodic writing itself. You&rsquo;ll hear a ton of trills and embellishments to provide color to the ending of phrases. Due to the roguelite nature you&rsquo;ll of course notice plenty of repetition, but done in a way that doesn&rsquo;t lose your attention. Repeated melodies are prevalent everywhere but gain some variability and flair through the doubling of other instruments, the use of call and response, countermelodies, and bringing back familiar ideas with different instrumentation.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The last element that helps keep the music fresh and interesting is that each level not only has its own theme, but separates that out into a combat theme, roaming theme, and night theme. Entering combat will typically have the percussion ramp up to a strong driving force while the music at night adopts a darker town and uses heavier instruments to take us through the chord progression.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The Call of the Ravenswatch&rdquo; kicks off after a cello trill followed by the main motif. The bagpipes then take over this idea, after which the mandola and keyed harp play their own game of call and response. They then hand the main idea back as the tin whistle joins in as a double with some new variations to the line. A super neat bagpipe bridge takes us into the repeat but once that's finished we get another somewhat emotional bridge where strong harmonies are built in the low strings while the violin plays a more lyrical version of our theme.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The second half of &ldquo;Enchanted Roads of Dark Hills&rdquo; is one of my favorite sections of music in the game. The second half kicks into gear with a call and response phrase; the cello as the response has such a raw edge to it that is always a blast to listen to. We follow that with a doubled string line with plenty of decorations and flourishes while the low strings strum along beneath. We then enter a break where some improv style lines in the middle strings&nbsp; interrupt the droning chords. Then we bring back our main idea with a twist and of course a lovely countermelody in the lower tones that ends with a trill line (similar to &ldquo;The Call of the Ravenswatch&rdquo; opening) with all other instruments cutting out. This sets up for a high energy end to the tune as the flute comes soaring in while doubled underneath by the violin. The last passage has the tin whistle floating with its own countermelody while the strings take it home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I really like how the flute and tin whistle are able to break into these pieces to provide some lightness and color while not disturbing the immersion at all. This holds true for many of the traditional instruments that feature in sections of each piece to provide an excellent distraction for your ears to latch on to.</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >&ldquo;Remains of Hogsden Village&rdquo; has a huge focus on layering and countermelodies. This piece plays during the quest of stage one as you defend the hogsden house. Enemies spawning all around the house to lay siege provides a hectic assault that you have to navigate through, and the music knows how to emphasize this. The intro is slow moving but quite impactful with all of the harmonies and instrumentation underneath the main line. Then the drums kick into full speed to provide momentum to our main melody. After the first phrase, we double the lead violin with a cello while changing the notes just a bit. From here, the piece diverges into several disparate lines, including a melody, countermelody, and sustaining chords. It&rsquo;s hard to choose one specific line to follow, which works great in a case where you&rsquo;ll hear this piece frequently; it won&rsquo;t sound the same way every time as you catch different elements of it each new run. This diverse layering maintains through the whole track which creates a truly interesting piece to listen to, which pairs well with a fight sequence that&rsquo;ll have you frantically moving around to defend from the chaotic onslaught.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Slay the Dullahan&rdquo; lends its attention to doubling and diverse instrumentation. This fight against fallen Arthur as a headless horseman is one of the few tracks to actually be written in a major key instead of the usual harmonic minor. This along with the strong horn backing throughout the piece gives the piece a more upbeat and regal tone which perfectly matches this encounter. The theme is set with strings only, then quickly taken over by high strings doubled by the tin whistle and the keyed harp while sustained notes from the brass raise the intensity. Then you know it gets real when </span><em><span >both</span></em><span > bagpipes join each other to play the next line. The violin and mandola get a lovely duet where all support drops out, followed closely by the bagpipes rejoining while the horns actually take our chord progression elsewhere as we move the piece along. Another duet moment comes in with the mandola and flute for a moment of quiet before the full force of our instrumentation comes in for the final phrase.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The first stage boss </span><span >&mdash; the master tentacle nightmare &mdash; has a slow moving but intense melody. After the bridge we enter a bass heavy section before a new melody takes the lead and is soon doubled. This is one of the more chaotic fights as you navigate a web of tentacles and lasers before finally staggering the main body for a damage cycle. The song gives you space to concentrate and methodically deal with the attacks before moving on as you progress through the fight. The master faceless nightmare of stage two is a lot more uptempo and groovy as the strummed ostinato and drums keep a driving pace the whole way through. Backing vocals and sustained harmonies from the brass build this fight up over time while the various traditional stringed instruments take their pass at the motif. There is no true lead instrument here, a faceless lead if you will that pairs well with the boss that focuses around duplicating its eyes to dish out laser attacks from every direction.The penultimate fight takes place during stage three as the master claw nightmare. We of course start out with a strong call and doubled response with slow moving but powerful drums. A solo string melody uses trills and pitch bends to set the stage of a twisted battle for the ages. We then get a great call and response section where the flute backed by horns alternates with our lead. Then an almost full orchestral sound comes in for the first time as a beautifully layered phrase that climaxes in a brief cello solo into the bridge filled with accented marcato notes. This breaks down into the bagpipe taking our melody doubled by the cello; this track does a great job at separating itself as being a tier up from the rest as you near the end of your journey</span></p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><span >The main points to list here in the spoiler section center around bosses which we&rsquo;ve looked at a bit in the music section above and unlockable characters which I&rsquo;ll discuss next.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Baba Yaga as a final boss works pretty well though her fight is split into two phases, the latter of which is only available if you&rsquo;re playing on the third or fourth difficulties. The first phase is pretty trivial given that you&rsquo;ve made it so far in the run and is mostly a place to flex your strength. Phase two ups the ante with a diverse moveset and some devastatingly powerful attacks. Melee builds may have a tough time as after the third skull attack, she has a defensive ring around her that deals contact damage. That combined with her frequent teleporting can make playing melee fighters feel quite frustrating, though the fight still maintains its intensity. She provides a solid and engaging challenge that can definitely end the run if you drop your guard, pretty much everything you&rsquo;re looking for in the final test before victory.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Unlocking new characters is pretty simple as it just requires you to beat chapter one with different characters. Again playing into the strength of the game, the theming and design of these characters is phenomenal. Aladdin as a dual scimitar wielding fighter who can channel a massive genie punch Sun Wukong who changes stances to use his magical staff for strong attacks or defensive blocks; Carmilla the vampire who can enter a bloodthirsty frenzy; Melusine the siren as the waterbending battlemage; and last but not least Gepetto, Pinocchio&rsquo;s dad comes in with his army of spinning puppets. This roster is just fun and has so many different ways to play.&nbsp;</span></p>
