                <p>Play as a spirit fox and make your way through a wondrous kingdom of Japanese influence as you platform and fight your way through this aerially focused Metroidvania.</p>

                <p><span >While there is plenty of combat this is a platform focused metroidvania with a heavy focus on movement. While you may be used to the genre putting your acquired skills to the test through platforming challenges, few make you adapt your fighting strategy to the skies as well. The movement is fluid and light which fits the goals very well and the platforming naturally follows this design.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >While you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to spend your time in the air, the core mechanic for combat is your tea kettle, which begins to boil the longer you spend without touching the floor. Upon boiling you are able to awaken your Daruma doll to enhance its customizable ability, a gameplay loop that is incredibly engaging and diverse. Bouncing up and down walls and betwixt enemies to push your kettle to the boiling point remained a constant challenge that was rewarding to execute on every time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As a result, you are incentivized to be in the air as much as you can which should sharpen your skills in combat which can translate to the platforming. The difficulty is non trivial especially for the dedicated platforming sections, and when they blend into the combat you&rsquo;ll certainly have your spiritual hands full as you navigate treacherous environments and folklore-inspired enemies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Popularized by Hollow Knight, the charm system is heavily present here in the form of Omamori (paper charms said to bring luck and protection in Buddhism) in addition to the ability to dynamically switch between Daruma dolls. These systems in addition to the aerial nature of the platforming and combat scenarios provide plenty of gameplay depth to keep the game enjoyable throughout.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >From a story and world perspective, Bo learns a lot from the Ori games. Sweeping across diverse biomes of the kingdom in order to combat some unnatural force that threatens the environment may not be the most original but it is certainly effective. Bo shines past this by having a central city under the protection of the Sakura Shogun where you can bring in new residents and learn more about the world. This larger narrative thread that occurs behind the scenes allows you to attach more to the characters and their place in the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Exploration is pretty solid overall and there are plenty of secrets and passages hiding worthwhile collectibles and upgrades. The fast travel system is quite connected as well so going around seldom felt like a chore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The art style is stunning honestly, taking a painting-esque background style while maintaining sharp and clear focus around the platforming and combat. The rich depth of Japanese folklore brings no shortage of creativity to character and enemy design and further enhances the visual quality.</span></p>

            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Given how much you&rsquo;re expected to be moving through the air during combat, combat arenas generally end up quite large. As a result, dynamic camera zooming attempts to give you a full view of the action, though this can sometimes make your character and incoming projectiles difficult to see. A certain optional boss exhibits this problem much more than most, though the design and art are able to atone for this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >If you&rsquo;re not used to platforming the game can certainly be challenging. I personally didn&rsquo;t have many issues here but the game has quite long sequences that you will need to restart if you die and this could certainly be an avenue of frustration</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The combat is pretty simplistic and ends up falling into a similar loop for many encounters. If deep combat is your thing you won&rsquo;t find much of that here, though the relatively novel nature of staying airborne kept me engaged and entertained.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >A Mexican composer works with a Thai studio for a soundtrack rooted in Japanese culture. And they absolutely nailed it; every piece is stellar. Several tracks establish a piano baseline alongside traditional Japanese instrumentation featuring many different flute leads. You&rsquo;ll also hear frequent koto and shamisen melodies which are plucked instruments and the Shakuhachi which is an elongated bamboo flute that is played vertically (like a clarinet!). Most pieces feature only light percussion such as light drums though they mostly rely on rim clicks to keep the rhythm; other than that you&rsquo;ll have large hits such as a gong or roll as the music swells.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Almost every track has great uses of countermelody, where an instrument plays a different melody around the main one as a kind of call and response. The pieces generally use different pitches of the same instrument, like a low and high flute for the melody and counter melody. This allows your ear to very easily follow the musical path that the composer has laid out without losing focus. Combine this with brilliant use of layers, just enough harmonies to enhance the repetitive moments in each piece, several repeated baselines varying in intensity, and sustained chords from all kinds of instruments and you have all of the ingredients for a masterpiece of a soundtrack. We&rsquo;ll dive a bit deeper into some of the tracks after the point of no return below.</span></p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >&ldquo;Maiden of the Bridge&rdquo;&nbsp; The first platforming sequence of the game and what a showing! Great energy right out of the gate&nbsp; all while flaunting diverse instruments with a mix of traditional (koto + shakuhachi) and modern (strings, piano, and flute). There are several interesting layers throughout this piece: the koto bassline plucked throughout, the piccolo line soaring above, low strings keeping the groove, an improv piano running through middle, this is an absolute joy to listen to.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Kitstune Burrows&rdquo; - Flute and piano take the lead to create a calm and relaxing groove sporting a reprise of the Kitsune leitmotif, putting a more playful twist to it by virtue of fluttering lines and fast moving notes even amidst a slower tempo.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Megumi Mountain&ldquo; - Another very chill groove featuring plucked instruments and really nice layering to always keep your ear searching for the next interesting idea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Sakura City&ldquo; - This tune builds as you stay in the city to catch up with old friends and upgrade your abilities. From lowkey to a more majestic swell (with a lovely piano roll) and then coming&nbsp; back down to make sure it always feels like home.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Forest of the Crimson Bamboo&ldquo; - We start out with soft piano lines and a plucked koto, eventually going through a chord progression to add some light horns that are just enough to pique your curiosity. We change chords again to have piano and strings take the lead while keeping a moving baseline. Then we finally have a chord breakdown bridge to reset the loop along with some jumpy woodwinds like the oboe. Great way to introduce the game and the soundtrack.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Uzumaki Cave&ldquo; - Our first dungeon has some low winds repeating a soft but eerie line. Pair this with quiet organ chords, mid register winds taking the melody, high winds holding sustained chords on top (doubled by strings), vacant drum beats, and an intermittent chime countermelody and you have an incredibly deep listen that made even a slower paced area at the start of the game feel engaging.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Midori Forest&ldquo; + &ldquo;Kitsura&ldquo; - The calm midori forest track presents the leitmotif of the kitsune, which of course comes back full swing as an intense but beautiful melodic line for your fight against Kitsura. This works incredibly well and serves as a great ribbon to place on this area of the game (just be sure to pet Kitsura afterwards).</span></p>

                    <p><span >While Kitsura has a great theme, this boss does exhibit a bit of the camera problem I mentioned earlier as you enter Phase 2. It is also an optional boss that you can choose to fight incredibly early, though I would not recommend fighting her as soon as she becomes available. Give it some time and you&rsquo;ll find the fight much more enjoyable. This fight is an absolutely beautiful sequence though and what kind of game would it be if you couldn&rsquo;t pet the fox afterwards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The reveal that the disasters caused throughout the game were not caused by Gashadokuro, but instead by Asahi who has accompanied you throughout your journey is a solid twist! You may have predicted it ahead of time but going through the Imperial Castle and reading his journal as a fall from grace really helps cement his flawed, yet understandable mission. This leads up to an excellent showdown against the Sakura Showdown which is a fun endurance fight spanning your adventure as a whole alongside a beautifully topical moonlit background.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Tengu Trio was a great love letter to the Mantis Lords from Hollow Knight, super fun! Warming up with the two of them combined with the narrative heavily imply what is to come, and mastering your aerial combat to float amongst them between your attacks is satisfying and elegant.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Every character throughout the game is so endearing, especially the ones found in Sakura City (Daruma Doll and Kettle Upgrades stand out in their design as well). Really take the time to read the dialog from each character as you&rsquo;ll find yourself smiling and getting attached to the world in no time.</span></p>

                <p><span >If you&rsquo;re a fan of Hollow Knight or metroidvanias in general, definitely give this game a go. The art, character design creativity, and soundtrack all come together into a world that is a joy to traverse through. The platforming is crisp yet demanding and the aerial combat loop is quite new and fun to pilot. Short and sweet so why not hop in and be the spirit fox you were always meant to be.</span></p>
