                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p>A futuristic cat society combining Chinese culture and cyberpunk cityscapes encompasses a relatively linear metroidvania with a parry-based combat system, an emotionally compelling story, all topped off with an excellent soundtrack.

                <p>When it comes to platformers for me one of the most important elements is how “tight” the movement feels. Nine Sols has no issue keeping up in this regard which is an extremely strong start for a combat centered game. It is a bit floatier than Hollow Knight and your attack animations are slightly clumsier, but the patterns that develop from the gameplay essentially negate these potential issues. The few segments that focus on platforming feel quite solid and don’t really give you any moments of frustration. That being said, the platforming is generally not challenging and is clearly not a core focus of the game, so if you’re looking for a mountainous endeavor like Celeste, it’s not here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The combat itself borrows heavily from Sekiro, centering itself around parrying and modifying the posture system. Enemy attacks can be dodged but you are incentivized to parry, acting as a sort of block which builds up your Qi meter and also deals some “internal” damage to enemies. You can use your Qi to plant an explosive talisman on enemies which detonates internal damage that they’ve taken. Combat results as a medley of dodging, attacking, and finding a window to detonate the talisman to finish off your opponents with a flourish. Fighting any enemy becomes a sort of rhythm game which provides immense satisfaction when you execute it well. The visual cues for parries are clear and the audio effect for a successful parry will easily have you going for more. Parry systems are not easy to get right and Nine Sols absolutely delivers here.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    When you hear metroidvania you will frequently find a close association with level design and exploration. The levels within the world of Nine Sols are well designed but the exploration is not too complex and there is not a strong amount of backtracking. For some, this can be a relief as you move through the story more or less linearly, enjoying tight level designs with the familiar shortcut mechanisms of Dark Souls games. For others, this may feel adrift from the typical metroidvania experience where frantic map markers pile up as you attempt to explore every nook of the world. While not convoluted, the reward for exploring is seldom disappointing as money, experience, and lore are all more than welcome during this journey.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I’m generally not a huge stickler for stories in games and you can see more details in the “Spoiler Zone” below, but this one hits pretty hard. It is endearing, tragic, depressing, and uplifting all at once and will likely give you that empty feeling once you’ve finished the game. You start out with the lone swordsman (catsman?) trope but quickly find yourself in the middle of a damaged world amidst change and asking how you will change with it. The game heavily revolves around the core themes of Taoism and acceptance, which when paired with a roster of characters that you grow to know and care for over the course of the game, can be quite impactful.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I’m no artist but the style for the game works very well and there are some absolutely beautiful scenes. No complaints from me here.

                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p>I really don’t have many critiques for this game, but there are a few gripes about combat that I think are the only things holding this game back from being immaculate: no iframes when you get hit and occasionally rough backswing hitboxes. When these occur they break the flow state that the game establishes so well, and push the game towards “hard” instead of “challenging”. Let it be known, the game is certainly difficult, but it is almost always fair aside from a few instances in fights where you may encounter the above critiques. By no means severe enough to ruin the experience, but they do hold it back just a bit.</p>

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>You know I’m going to talk about the music at some point so here we go: it slaps. At some points you hear ambient industrial sounds mixed with traditional instrumentation. At others you’ll have a lone melodical flute along with a quiet breeze. Fighting off swarms of enemies to an electric guitar mixed with plucks of a guqin fueled by the wails of a full choir, or sweeping woodwinds encouraging you in the fight of your life. This soundtrack delivers across the board from ambient levels, to emotional cutscenes, to stellar boss fights. We’ll talk more about what makes this music so good in the spoiler section.</p>

                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p>Okay we continue the music train here: leitmotif central all throughout this game! Quick explanation of leitmotif: basically a short-ish melody that represents a concept, character, or event. Take the imperial march from Star Wars whenever Darth Vader shows up, for example. Whenever that theme plays, you understand that it means that the Empire or Anakin&rsquo;s dark side is prevailing. Similarly in Nine Sols, we have several themes that represent Yi, the Sols, birth, death, resolution, and hope (humans). Each of these can be found throughout the entire game but we&rsquo;ll take a look at a few examples here.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>First, the main theme. This one is everywhere, but basically represents Yi as a whole. Lots of characters represent different parts of Yi which is why they&rsquo;re so prevalent here. See if you can find it for yourself within these tracks!</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>&ldquo;Memory of You&rdquo;, Heng&rsquo;s first message</li>
                    <li>&ldquo;Stargazer&rdquo;, Hen&rsquo;s second message</li>
                    <li>&ldquo;Inner Voice&rdquo;, first time meeting Ruyi</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The same theme again but slowed down for Ruyi&rsquo;s death (this one was the most tragic for me&hellip;)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>&ldquo;The End of New Kunlun&rdquo;, true ending scene where Fusang gets infected by the tianhuo</li>
                    <li>Main Theme II, second scene of the true ending when we see the Pale Blue planet</li>
                    <li>&ldquo;The Path for Us All&rdquo;, during the true ending fight
                    <ul>
                    <li>This takes a variation of the leitmotif to match the energy and flow of the moment</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Then we have the theme of the Sols themselves, high tempo repeated eighth notes to really make sure you know you&rsquo;re in a boss battle:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The bells at 0:08 into In &ldquo;Long Awaited Death&rdquo;, Ji&rsquo;s Theme</li>
                    <li>The female voice at 0:20 in &ldquo;Our Passion&rdquo;, Fuxi and Nuwa&rsquo;s theme</li>
                    <li>The low electric guitar at 0:03 in &ldquo;Ballad of Warriors, Jiequan&rsquo;s Theme</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Ah the theme of the apemen (humans) which to me symbolizes hope. Not for the Solarians but for the continuation of life as it should be:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>This one is really subtle. At the very end of &ldquo;Memory of You&rdquo;, listen to the glockenspiel for just 4 little notes</li>
                    <li>The strings at 0:31 in &ldquo;Main Theme II&rdquo; play those little 4 notes and extend them into their full leitmotif. And they play a beautiful harmony for it as well, wow</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>How could we not have a leitmotif that indicates a conclusion to our story. The Resolution leitmotif is heavily connected to Yi&rsquo;s theme, hence why it is present in all of these pieces as well:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Female voice and piano at 0:36 in &ldquo;The Lone Sol&rdquo;, true ending scene where Yi detonates the Rhizomatic arrow</li>
                    <li>The piano at 0:23 in &ldquo;Farewell&rdquo;, when you talk to Kuafu after choosing to save the humans</li>
                    <li>&ldquo;The Path for Us All&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t actually have this leitmotif, but listen to the strings at 0:16! Does that sound familiar to the other pieces in this section?</li>
                    <li>In &ldquo;Main Theme II&rdquo;, After a huge swell and instant fade out, the cello just steals the show at 0:57 to bring this theme back.&nbsp;</li>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Not only that, it finishes off this leitmotif for the first time at 1:21 by resolving the chord with 2 added notes to finally close out this&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>And then you KNOW this all wrap up with a grand recapitulation of Yi&rsquo;s theme followed by the Humans leitmotif</li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>So basically the music is alright, isn&rsquo;t it? It is truly incredible how well they were able to piece this whole soundtrack together and make it pack such an emotional punch. Absolutely gorgeous.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I haven&rsquo;t even gone that deep into instrumentation but the blend of industrial drumstep and traditional Chinese instrumentation is so strange but it works! Then they bring in a full choir and orchestra for the big moments to let you know that they&rsquo;ve got this soundtrack on lock. Personally the more grungy synth tracks and metallic ambience is not my vibe, but it suits what they were going for. The narrative moments where they pull out the full musical stops or really lean into the cultural influences are what really make elements of this soundtrack stand out for me. And now on to less musical yapping.</p>

                    <h3>Content</h3>
                    <p><p><span >Parry parry parry, get used to parrying. I would not recommend approaching basically any fight in this game without a &ldquo;parry first&rdquo; mindset. Your life will be so much easier with this mentality along with understanding the unbound parry ability. The strength of this move is a key asset for the game and can be used outside of its &ldquo;defend against dark red moves&rdquo; introduction. This concept is absolutely true for the rest of the game and is absolutely essential for conquering the final fight.</span></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span >The Fuxi and Nuwa fight was a standout one for me: a cyberpunk infused chinese opera with the backdrop of a nightclub overrun by the infection. The fight structure itself is reminiscent of a certain boss in Dark Souls III and the flow state that follows is just as satisfying. I wish the unbound overhead slam had a slightly more forgiving window when Nuwa used her twin needle attack, but overall a thrilling and enjoyable fight. Also her attacks coming from her Hulusi (known as a gourd flute) is a great musical touch and fits the deranged opera theme well.</span></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span >Lady Ethereal was another very well done fight with an exceptional setting. Her attacks are fast yet fair and keeping track of her shadow clones keep the fight engaging. One minor issue I have with this fight stems from a general trend in games that I am not a fan of which is when a boss is &ldquo;unhittable&rdquo; for extended periods of time. Chase sequences are totally fine but when you&rsquo;re in the midst of combat and a boss just leaves your area to use a long sequence of attacks, I find that the flow breaks too easily. In Phase 3 she sometimes crosses that barrier a bit too much, but not a huge deal and certainly does not detract from the hype.</span></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span >The true ending adds a 3rd phase to the final boss. This is certainly the hardest fight in the game by quite some margin, and one of the tougher fights in general for games. It is an extremely long fight demanding near perfection for most of the time. All that being said, once you understand this fight it is immaculate. It becomes a rhythmic flow state where you can plan every step of the fight as it manifests before you. If this fight was just a bit shorter it would probably help, and the attack introduced in Phase 3 is pretty tough to read for your first several encounters with it.&nbsp;</span></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><span >My goodness I wasn&rsquo;t expecting the story to be so SAD. Even in the true ending where your brain can tell you things are better, the build up to and including the final fight, following cutscenes, and music combined can really hit you hard. After the entire game of bonding with the guests of the Four Seasons Pavillion, especially Shuanshuan, the last act is a tearjerker for sure.</span></p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Overall I would absolutely recommend this game, it is quite brilliant. If you enjoyed Hollow Knight or Sekiro, give it a go. If you want to challenge your combat skills, give it a go. If you want a holistic metroidvania or action platformer experience, give it a go. Even if you just want to explore the world and story, give it a go in “story mode”. Top contender of the genre and great experience, just be prepared for a challenge and some heartbreak.</p>
