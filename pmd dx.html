                <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
                <p><span >My favorite Pokemon spinoff returns with a remake of the original game! Navigate through randomly generated floors of various dungeons in a grid-based layout in this interesting take on the traditional turn-based combat formula. Add on a touching story about friendship and a modernization of the stellar soundtrack and you&rsquo;ve got a gem that shines brighter than just nostalgia.</span></p>

                <h3>Content</h3>
                <p><span >Pokemon Mystery Dungeon DX (just DX from here on out) is a remake of the original title of this spinoff series, Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue Rescue Team. DX keeps the story and characters exactly the same while updating the gameplay systems to match those of the more recent entries in the series and completely overhauling the art style.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Speaking of the art style, it will immediately jump out at you so we&rsquo;ll start there. The game sports a watercolor aesthetic reminiscent of </span><em><span >Okami</span></em><span >, uses 3D models instead of sprites, and has beautiful illustrations for the title screen and in-game menus.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay but what is the core gameplay loop for this offshoot of the pokemon series? You&rsquo;ll explore randomly generated dungeon layouts that are filled with wild pokemon, items, and traps. Movement takes place on a grid based where every action (taking a step, making an attack, or using an item) counts as a turn. You&rsquo;ll have to manage hunger and power points (PP) of moves while battling and recruiting defeated pokemon to your team. Encountering a wild pokemon in a room turns into an analysis where you&rsquo;ll decide how you want to spend your turn &mdash; should you move to another square, use a ranged attack, or delve into your toolbox to find an item. This loop presents a familiar yet meaningfully different deviation from traditional pokemon combat that adds an extra layer of strategy that is quite engaging. This system also leaves room for cool interpretations of mechanics from the mainline games like priority moves: instead of moving before your opponent in a turn based battle, these priority moves actually have an extended range on the grid to provide the same feeling of sneaking in an attack before your opponent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >As I mentioned, the story remains unchanged from the originals which is totally fine by me &mdash; it&rsquo;s filled with charm and can even pack an emotional punch. The main game&rsquo;s plot is short and sweet, but the real magic of DX comes through in the postgame. The full payoff of the story actually occurs pretty deep into the postgame, requiring the completion of several late game dungeons. It&rsquo;s nothing groundbreaking, but even a story meant to teach children what it means to be good to others can still resonate with adults.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Though not part of the gameplay, one of my favorite details of the game are the main menu icons. As you progress throughout the story, your achievements of conquering certain challenges or befriending certain pokemon will manifest as icons on your save file. This is such a charming way to track your progress; who doesn&rsquo;t love seeing legendary and mythical pokemon populate your rescue team&rsquo;s resume.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Let&rsquo;s chat a bit about the main differences between DX and its predecessor, though some of them will be covered in the pain points section below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The biggest difference is rare qualities, which are an overhaul of the IQ system from the original games. Instead of feeding your pokemon a specific gummi (yes I spelled it correctly) to prevent them from walking randomly or give them a skill to increase evasion, pokemon can instead have a rare quality attached to them. There are thirty four different rare qualities in the game, ranging from totally useless to game breaking. Both systems require the consumption of gummies &mdash; for IQ you had to farm specific gummies for the pokemon you wanted to enhance while in DX there are only two types of gummies. Rainbow gummies provide a small stat boost and have a chance to grant a rare quality while DX gummies are guaranteed to offer a rare quality. Since the skill tree mechanic of the IQ system was removed in favor of rare qualities, a significant portion of your team&rsquo;s power budget will come down to these effects. Overall, this change has cut down on the lengthy process required to max out the IQ of a pokemon while removing some of the more nuanced strategies and team building that the IQ system made possible.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >A few minor differences in&nbsp; DX also include the removal of basic attack (kind of, NPCs can use it), the ability to have up to 8 teammates in a dungeon, and an excellent reprise for peace of mind: autosave. The strange one here is the removal of the basic attack, which was a flat power move that any pokemon could use without spending any power points to use an attack. This still exists in the game, as other pokemon can use this if they have no moves available, but is no longer available to the player. The primary consequence of this is requiring the player to be more conscious of their power point economy and more highly prioritize items and rare qualities that preserve PP. </span></p>

            <!-- Section for Pain Points -->
            <section id="pain points">
                <h3>Pain Points</h3>
                <p><span >Now even though a lot of the mechanics in this game have been updated to match modern standards, there are still a few elements in this game that still miss the mark for me. The biggest one is the grind behind the rare quality system &mdash; it can be extremely cumbersome to get the rare qualities you want, especially given the rather bloated pool since so many of them aren&rsquo;t really useful. Of the thirty four available rare qualities, only fifteen or so are desirable and usually you&rsquo;re looking for a few specific ones for a given Pokemon. Fortunately the overhauled gummi system allows you to reroll for rare qualities for Pokemon that you&rsquo;ve already recruited, but the limited quantity of DX Gummis presents a real barrier. Not only that, but while digging for a rare quality these gummies can offer you a rare quality that you&rsquo;ve already passed up in that same interaction. This can be an absolutely frustrating process that does more harm than good in my opinion. I'd say some kind of pity system would go a long way in making this process more enjoyable while still requiring sufficient exploration and commitment from the player.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >This leads into a related issue: recruiting pokemon can be an absolute hassle, especially when you factor in looking for specific rare qualities. Passing countless turns on a floor of a dungeon to hope for a recruitment with a reasonable rare quality loses its luster quite quickly, though the alternatives are limited given the gummi situation we&rsquo;ve already covered. That&rsquo;s not to say the game doesn&rsquo;t give you avenues to maximize your recruitment chance: the rare qualities friendly and squad up, rare quality orb, inviting orb, friend bow, and false swipe all boost your recruitment to make the process much smoother. Even with that though, it can still be a lengthy endeavor to finally hit the combo you&rsquo;re looking for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >When you combine this with the strange change in this version where you can no longer view the recruitable pokemon on each floor of a dungeon, actually knowing where to even find a pokemon that you want to add to your team becomes a prerequisite to the grind. I&rsquo;m not quite sure why this was removed, but it factors into a larger category of problems that plague pokemon games in general: a wide range of information is not available in-game. In addition to not being able to check where to find different pokemon, smaller details like level one learnsets, teachable TMs, and the purpose of certain dungeons are all not findable while playing and require trial and error or researching online. Not a huge problem, but something that would make the game feel more holistic.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another pattern you may have picked up on in my complaints so far is the problem of limited items &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s the exciting gameplay presented by empowerment seeds, gameplay progression via gummies, rare quality orbs, and inviting orbs, or the comforting presence of decoy seeds, the fact that these beneficial and interesting consumables are not consistently farmable makes it feel like a large investment to use them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The main feature from the original games that I truly wish made it into the remake is having the rescue team camps be visitable in the game world. Recruiting a pokemon into a new camp that you just bought was an exciting moment as you would travel there and see your new friend underwater lit by bioluminescent coral, frolicking through a flowery meadow, or meditating atop a towering peak. In the remake the camps do have a beautifully crafted illustration to go with them, but are otherwise just a list of the pokemon that reside there. Still nice but nowhere near as charming as the original concept.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Okay my final gripe is trifling but the final rank achievable in the game is flat out silly. The Grandmaster rank requires a staggering 100k rescue points to reach compared to the 50k and 60k point thresholds of the two previous levels. Now I wouldn&rsquo;t actually care about this at all if the final main menu icon was not for reaching this point. Every other challenge in the game felt great and reasonable to accomplish, but the grind to get this ultimate rank is simply too much to be enjoyable. Having the final slot in the menu, otherwise decorated with pokemon that you&rsquo;ve befriended on your adventure, reserved for a rescue rank well beyond the scope of the rest is not my preferred way for capping off the 100% in this game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Most of these issues don&rsquo;t actually affect the main gameplay loop that you&rsquo;ll interface with over the course of a playthrough. It only really affects those who want to shoot for a full completion or build different teams around specific strategies (or those who just enjoy mega evolution). While playing both versions of the game have given me a lens into the benefits and drawbacks of their differences, I still found DX to be incredibly entertaining. While the systems aren&rsquo;t perfect, they are certainly sufficient to facilitate a great experience for both new and returning players.</span></p>

            <!-- Section for Music -->
            <section id="music">
                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p><span >The music in the mystery dungeon series mostly aims for the background that is simultaneously grand, calming, and groovy. You&rsquo;ll be hearing these dungeon themes on repeat as you explore floor after floor, yet the songs do a phenomenal job at keeping you engaged the whole time. Catchy melodies, funky basslines, sustained string lines, and a variety of percussion instruments all contribute to making each dungeon feel alive and a joy to adventure through.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Another huge element of the music in the mystery dungeon series is the use of leitmotifs &mdash; a musical phrase that represents some idea. The originals and DX use this technique for the major plot points and set up the future games for a full exploration (pun intended) of leitmotifs and how impactful they can be for storytelling. We&rsquo;ll cover the major leitmotifs present in this game as we discuss my favorite tracks so stay tuned.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >I already covered the gameplay differences between the two versions of this game so let&rsquo;s do it for the music as well. The soundtrack in DX is incredibly faithful, only opting to modernize some of the instrumentation and make minor changes to the arrangement. Even the bass is kept on the crunchier side to emulate the 16-bit feel from the originals while still blending seamlessly into the modern composition. For the following music analysis I&rsquo;ll just stick to the soundtrack from DX, but listening to the older versions certainly will give you an appreciation for how well they were able to create a distinct atmosphere for each dungeon on limited hardware.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >We&rsquo;ll cover a few tracks together: &ldquo;Title Theme&rdquo;, &rdquo;File Select&rdquo;, and &rdquo;Pokemon Square&rdquo; all introduce the rescue team leitmotif for the first time ever and it&rsquo;s a great one. &ldquo;Title Screen&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have time for pleasantries and leads with the first part of the motif right away in the strings. At 0:15 we have a small reprise from the grand nature of this track with a harp triplet ostinato in the background while a flute plays the second phrase of this theme. &ldquo;File Select&rdquo; gives us a slowed down version of the full leitmotif in the harpsichord and flute, respectively. This mellow version is perfect for browsing through the menu and preparing for your adventure. &ldquo;Pokemon Square&rdquo; serves as the hub theme for the game and what better way to do that than to bring in the classic leitmotif at 0:13 in the violin with a harmony in the bass synth. The flute classically takes the following phrase while the strings support with some beautiful chords and a slow moving line underneath. Syncopated stabs along with the percussion keep the track moving to provide a high energy but peaceful theme &mdash; perfect for one that you&rsquo;ll hear the most out of any in the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Great Canyon&rdquo; plays as you make your way through the dungeon of the same name to seek the wisdom of Xatu. Right off the bat we have a choral glissando and a marimba playing the main background ostinato for this track. After a brief flute interlude the bass comes in while a synth doubles the ostinato and the strings play a drawn out, tenuto melody. At 0:36 the tribal chant feeling of this piece enters full swing as the synth bass moves to the foreground with an exceptionally funky pattern backed by some retro style synthesizers. This track will make you want to sway like a pack of Cacturne in the desert.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Mt. Blaze&rdquo; starts out aggressively like a militaristic march with timpani, bass synth, and marcato trumpets &mdash;&nbsp; fitting enough for a literal volcano. 0:20 brings in a softer texture with long string chords and a sparkling-sounding synth playing a sixteenth pattern. Eventually we bring back the trumpets at 0:38, this time as background while the violins play the lyrical melody with some flute embellishments. 0:57 drops out the strings and brass in favor of the choir, before handing the main idea back to the flute and strings who double each other for this final loop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Before moving on to the spoiler section, I wanted to cover some of the friend area themes. Each camp has a unique theme so I&rsquo;ll just do a blitz version for some of the standouts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&rdquo;Friend Area ~ Field&rdquo; is bubbly happiness incarnate, you can really imagine the Jumpluff just floating around here. Two octave glockenspiel takes the opening melody while the strings play a harmony pattern underneath; not to mention a crunchy bass follows the melody. The second idea is a triple rhythm in the strings this time while the glockenspiel augments the phrase with some ornaments; the bass is still going crazy, it&rsquo;s not often you get a bass sliding up and down like this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&rdquo;Friend Area ~ Steppe&rdquo; is a charming waltz in the classic &frac34; time signature which evokes a lilting feeling, like an almost too-slow dance. After a cheery intro we have a synth play an eighth note pattern in the background while the string section sets our waltz pattern. The main melody is on the flute with another flute supporting the line with harmonies, while a clarinet rounds off the phrase with a counter melody. We then pass the theme to the clarinet while the glockenspiel and flute take turns to play the counter melody. A lovely back and forth to keep the song interesting and upbeat without losing our interest.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >&rdquo;Friend Area ~ Oceanic&rdquo; sounds so dramatic but it also establishes an amazing tone that emulates the serenity and pressure of being deep under water. From the beginning we have a heavily distorted bass, string chords, and an eighth note pattern from a high pitched synth. A glockenspiel soon doubles the sustained strings before both instruments play sparse runs up and down, echoing one another. The mechanical nature and reiteration of ideas certainly fits the vibe for these rescue camps.</span></p>

                <!-- Section for Spoiler Music -->
                <section id="music">
                    <h3>Music</h3>
                    <p><span >One of the most iconic themes in the mystery dungeon series and one that will certainly leave a strong impression when you encounter it for the first time is of course &ldquo;Monster House&rdquo;. These are rooms on a dungeon floor that&nbsp; have a random chance to spawn; upon entering one, a horde of wild pokemon will spawn in while this song takes over the previous dungeon theme. These are typically quite tense situations that can certainly spell the end of a run so the intensity of the music is ready to match. We start out with some brass stabs, a retro sounding keyboard, and a fast moving bassline to grab your attention. Then the violin comes in with a solo that sounds like the </span><em><span >Mission Impossible </span></em><span >theme but quickly takes its own shape with a blazing fast run up to an epic call and response section. The brass stabs return but much faster this time while the violin soloist responds with an improv-like run, which happens again but this time doubled by the keyboard. This pattern repeats once more but with the keyboard taking the solo response before getting doubled by the violin on the second bar. We then enter a jazzy bridge where the trumpets take the center before going back into the classic stabs doubled by the keyboard before ending the loop. The frantic nature of the solos and sharpness of the brass accents fully emphasizes the chaotic state that comes about when you encounter a monster house and is why this tune is so memorable.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The soundtrack for the final dungeon, &ldquo;Sky Tower&rdquo;, serves as the finale for the main story as you ascend through the clouds to face off with Rayquaza. This piece is uplifting in its tone and hopeful in its instrumentation, yet what will keep you coming back to this piece is the rhythmic layering. There are so many different moving lines throughout this track from the groovy bass synth to the beautiful string lines and all the way up to the heavenly chimes that toll the bell of the inevitable showdown at the summit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >We start out with a glockenspiel ostinato and a sustained note in the violins; soon afterwards though an eighth note synth pattern, bass synth, choir, and flute melody all join the party. At 0:24, we now add in another synth playing a rapid sixteenth note figure. Then we hit 0:33 where the synth bass properly starts and the full string section plays sustained chords &mdash; at this point we have around eight different moving lines with different rhythmic subdivisions and patterns which makes for an extremely interesting listen. Once the string chords reach their peak at 0:49 we shift into a lovely pizzicato melody from the violins where each phrase is appended by the chimes (and actually doubled by the bass). After one full loop of these interwoven lines we reach the bridge at 1:22 which drops out a decent bit of the instrumentation, mostly featuring the bass and of course ending with the chimes once more. Once more we have a loop of the main idea before 2:02 brings forth an emotional flute solo that is both parts melancholic and heroic. At 2:56 this solo gets passed to the violin to become a beautiful duet where the violin plays the response to the call of the flute. Having each instrument provide a unique take on the melody for a full repetition and then combining the two for the third repetition is a great way to build upon the theme while still creating new hooks for the listener to catch, stellar.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >It&rsquo;s time to cry as these next two tracks all feature the farewell leitmotif, played when it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye even when you don&rsquo;t want to. &rdquo;Run Away, Fugitives&rdquo; of course happens when you&rsquo;re accused as the pokemon that bears the curse that will destroy the world and it is only fitting that the theme is equally as tragic. The choir opens up alone before the flute plays this leitmotif for the first time and then again at 0:53 in the glockenspiel. This theme is heartwrenching and the emotional violin solo at 1:33 does not make it any less painful. In &rdquo;Parting ~ Farewell&rdquo; we hear the leitmotif in the glockenspiel behind a somber flute melody as you slowly begin to disappear from the pokemon world. In this truly sad moment we see the despair of our partner pokemon who doesn&rsquo;t understand why we can&rsquo;t stay together. At 0:40 we get another violin solo, but this time it plays the leitmotif in all its sorrow as our partner breaks down and we vanish.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Then we have &ldquo;Staff Roll ~ Credits&rdquo; &mdash; as we reflect on the loss of a true and irreplaceable friend the farewell leitmotif again plays in the glockenspiel. We don&rsquo;t have much time to mourn though as at 1:03 we go into full swing with the rescue team leitmotif as the credits roll. Not all is sad though because after the credits we decide that staying in the realm of pokemon for the bond we&rsquo;ve created with our partner is worth it. &ldquo;Time of Reunion&rdquo; plays as we slowly begin to materialize again and at 0:39 we hear a slowed down variation on the rescue team leitmotif one final time, before the upbeat intro to the main theme plays as our partner overflows with relief upon realizing that we are back and here to stay. Who said Pokemon couldn&rsquo;t be heartfelt and touching?</span></p>

                    <p><span >The core story of DX is actually not too long &mdash; only a fraction of the total number of dungeons of the game are required to see the credits roll. And though the main narrative does indeed wrap up after your first visit to Sky Tower, full closure doesn&rsquo;t occur until you finally reach the Murky Cave to resolve the Gengar storyline. While the main story is not complex, the plot twist where you aren&rsquo;t the human that abandoned Gardevoir as spoken of in the Ninetales legend may actually come as a surprise. The fugitive arc and how it ties into the gameplay in the form of a multi-dungeon gauntlet creates proper tension that will have you worrying about leaving your belongings behind. And of course the final showdown with Rayquaza followed by the triumphant return of the player character back to the Pokemon world after an emotional goodbye is still a touching moment that this series never seems to miss on; turns out the bond between people and pokemon really is that strong.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >After the meteor plot wraps up, we&rsquo;ve entered the post game which mostly exists as a series of new hazardous dungeons where someone got lost or injured. These all lead to a different legendary pokemon guarding the end which you&rsquo;ll eventually recruit to your team. This includes revisiting some of the story dungeons to fight powered up versions of the main bosses. These refights are actually hype, especially those of the Generation 3 trio &mdash; Kyogre and Groudon undergoing primal reversion to act as phase two of the fight is epic, while similarly Rayquaza mega evolves to put up one of the hardest combat encounters in the game. Between these cinematic battles where your preparation will be put to the test, there are several jovial interludes that either provide some humor or charming decorations to your rescue team base. Overall I found the bulk of the post game to be quite engaging with the amount of new pokemon and dungeons that came my way.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >One of the dungeons you&rsquo;ll find while clearing the post game is the Buried Relic. Not only is this the home of the elusive pokemon Mew, it is also the key location to farm upgrade items for your stats. This is one of the first times where you&rsquo;ll actually need to do some teambuilding, as all of the stat boosting items are hidden in the walls of the dungeon. You&rsquo;ll need one of your party members holding the &ldquo;X-Ray Specs&rdquo; as well as a ghost type or teammate with the &ldquo;Forge a Path&rdquo; rare quality to actually extract the riches concealed throughout the relic. While this is technically not required, taking the time to power up here is more or less mandatory if you want to clear some of the tougher post game content (like the re-fights we discussed earlier) and I like that it serves as an introduction to more rigorous planning before going into a dungeon. I do wish it was a bit clearer in the game that investing time in this dungeon was quite important, but otherwise executing on your plan and seeing how strong you become as a result is satisfying.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >Now something that is more relieving than satisfying is the endeavor to recruit Mew in the buried relic. Not only do you need to get lucky enough to recruit Mew and not only does Mew exclusively appear on five set floors of the buried relic, but Mew also knows the move transform which means that it could be masquerading as any of the pokemon on that floor. This turns this recruitment search into a tense prowl where you&rsquo;ll need to keep your eyes on the message log and ensure that your team&rsquo;s moves are disabled to not steal the last hit. Make sure to bring all of your recruitment boosting items that we spoke about in the pain points section to give yourself the best odds at conquering this battle of attrition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span ><br /></span><span >Another type of location you&rsquo;ll find later on in the postgame are the treasure dungeons. These twelve areas are generally short (not all of them though) dungeons that always contain a treasure room at the end. This is the most efficient way to grind for deluxe boxes (for gummies) and evolution crystals, otherwise there isn&rsquo;t anything too noteworthy about these optional dungeons.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span >The pantheon of difficulty in the postgame of DX are the reset dungeons, with Purity Forest being the most notable. This 99 floor dungeon doesn&rsquo;t allow you to bring any items in, forces you to enter alone, and resets your level to five. This is the ultimate test of your knowledge, dungeoneering mechanics and teambuilding. Even with all of these it will still require several resets to get a good opening and likely quite a few attempts to overcome this challenge. Knowing the possible movesets of wild pokemon, how to position your recruited allies, and when to use the tools you find along the way are absolutely crucial for success. This heavily warps the usual gameplay pattern from one that is more relaxed to a high tension environment where you&rsquo;ll be planning almost every move. While I think the difficulty may be a bit too high for a dungeon to feature an interesting twist on the gameplay, it&rsquo;s still an enjoyable ultimate test to prepare for and inevitably conquer. Your reward for this feat is &mdash; aside from the silly grandmaster rank &mdash; the most difficult icon to acquire in DX along with the recruitment of the time travel pokemon, Celebi.</span></p>
